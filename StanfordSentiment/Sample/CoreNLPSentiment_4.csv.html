The European Union has started removing the United Kingdom from its maps, two years before it formally leaves the bloc.

The maps, which appear in the European Commission’s report Reflection Paper on the Social Dimension of Europe, show the UK greyed out along with non-EU states.

The diagrams are designed to highlight unemployment and quality of life within the European Union, but conspicuously miss Britain out. The paper says it wants to be part of a “wide debate on the future European Union with 27 Member States”.

Conservative MP and Leave campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg praised the maps, saying the showed the EU had given up on trying to stop Brexit.

He told MailOnline: “I think they are brilliant, I am absolutely delighted that officials in the European Union have recognised that we are leaving and are speeding the process along.

“But perhaps they would like to give us a discount on our bills if they have decided we have left already.

“I thought we would win the Brexit vote, but if you had asked me just before the 2015 election if I thought the EU would be painting us out of its maps I would have been astonished.

“I think it is good news they are recognising reality rather than trying to keep us in.

“But of course as we leave their figures get worse, because our economy is strong and we flatter the EU statistics.

“Their statistics will take a bit of a tumble with us airbrushed out.”

Britain formally triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty in March, beginning the two-year process of leaving the EU. This means that Britain is still a member of the bloc for the next two years. However, the European Commission is now clearly planning for life after Brexit.

After Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50, support for Brexit hit a five-month high, with one poll putting support on 55 per cent.</td>

Interns at top technology companies, including Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon, earn more money than the average American, according to a new report.

Facebook interns were reported to earn around $8,000 per month, followed by Microsoft interns at $7.1k per month.

ExxonMobil and Salesforce were both reported to pay their interns $6.5k a month, while interns at Amazon, Apple, Bloomberg, and Yelp all took home $6.4k per month.

As pointed out by the report, the average full-time American earns roughly $4.3k a month, which is nearly half of what the young interns at Facebook are bringing in.

“The data highlights the growing income inequality among Americans across different job sectors,” Axios reported. “As CNBC points out, a paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research in December reveals that the average income of Americans in the bottom half of the income spectrum has remained stagnant at $16,000 since 1980. Meanwhile, the average income of the top one-percent of American adults has risen from $420,000 to $1.3 million from 1980 to 2014.”

Facebook employees also receive medical, dental, and vision insurance, life insurance, paid leave for new parents, “generous” vacation days, family planning support, transportation support, and even “meals and snacks when you need them,” placing the company at number one on Glassdoor’s “best places to work in tech” list and at number two on the site’s best places to work overall.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly were joined by members of the Remembrance Project, a non-profit dedicated to giving a voice to those killed by illegal aliens, at their joint border security event Friday in San Diego.

Sessions and Kelly joined Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) as they continued their joint tour of border communities to address the crisis in immigration enforcement. The two members of Trump’s cabinet met privately with delegations including family members of those murdered by illegals and Remembrance Project leaders in recent months.

Maria Espinoza, Co-Founder and National Director of the Remembrance Project, was thrilled by the change in direction she heard at the press conference, telling Breitbart News:

These joint press conference in indicative of the dedication and commitment America will enjoy with America’s new era – the Trump Era! We had the high honor of having separate and private meetings with U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly. We went away knowing that our country is in excellent hands, and we are encouraged to work with even more vigor to protect our families. Our 2014 meeting with [former Homeland Security Secretary] Jeh Johnson and former Attorney General Holder was a stark contrast. And that’s a travesty. But now, Americans are finally the priority in America!

Ruth Johnson-Martin is what the Remembrance Project calls an “angel wife,” someone whose husband was killed by an illegal alien. Her late husband, Police Officer Don Johnston, was shot and paralyzed during a 1990 bank robbery and later died from his injuries. She also attended Friday’s press conference. “The Remembrance Project is here in San Diego showing our full support,” she told Breitbart News. She too was encouraged by the change in leadership, adding:

Illegal immigration is a serious issue in the State of California and many American families have lost loved ones to criminal acts committed by illegal aliens and refugees. Many families like mine have suffered in silence, but that is no longer the case with President Trump, AG Sessions and Secretary Kelly we now have a voice!

The joint press conference, the second Kelly and Sessions have held this week, is part of an effort to promote their measures to bring the long-troublesome southern border under control. At the first conference in El Paso, for example, Kelly reconfirmed that the border wall will be “essential.” Sessions, for his part, began the process of withdrawing funds from so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions like California.

The Remembrance Project delegation, for one, is exuberant at the progress. “I am thrilled to pieces that finally, after eight long years, we finally have an administration that will enforce the law,” said Betty Robinson of Remembrance Project California.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/lMhP8dNNm_0/why-trump-his-team-and-congress-should-listen-to-americas-business-leaders.html</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>Just over one hundred days into a new administration, what are American businesses thinking? What do they need to succeed? What public policies will help them spur greater economic growth?

One of the U.S. Chamber’s top priorities is to listen to Main Street businesses—and make sure Washington listens to them as well. In conjunction with our state and local partners, the U.S. Chamber invited hundreds of businesses to share their ideas on how to boost economic growth in a series of meetings across the country.

During the first quarter of 2017, events were held in Chicago, Phoenix, Baton Rouge, Atlanta, and Detroit. Topics included energy, health care, capital markets, workforce and education, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

In our discussions with these Main Street businesses, there were five key takeaways:

First, businesses are optimistic about the future and maintain a “can do” attitude. Many are excited about having a businessman in the White House. Many see the economy beginning to come back to life as regulations are reduced and a real prospect for tax reform comes into view. A business owner in Georgia told us, “It’s busy; it’s cranking.”

Second, despite their renewed optimism, businesses tell us tax and regulatory burdens impede their growth and success. A business owner in Michigan said: “There will always be regulation, but it doesn’t have to be so burdensome. There will always be taxes, but they don’t have to be so punitive. Give us an opportunity to grow our business and let us be able to reinvest and hire people.”

Third, finding qualified workers is the single biggest challenge facing business. We are a nation of people without jobs and jobs without people. Businesses can’t find workers with the proper education and skills to fill openings. This is an anchor on their growth and is undermining our economy.

Many businesses expressed strong support for shoring up our K–12 education system and bolstering vocational and technical training, as well as apprenticeships. Said one business owner from Louisiana: “College is not for everyone. We need more vocational and tech training. Our society feels a college degree should be obtained by everyone, and it shouldn’t. God made us all different, and we all have different talents.”

Fourth, businesspeople have a true passion for our free enterprise system. Many argued that they never would have been able to go into business, fail, try again, and succeed beyond their expectations under any other system. And all agreed that free enterprise was not only about helping yourself, but ultimately helping others.

One business owner described it like this: “Free enterprise to me is being able to have a business that offers value and service to another person or another business, to be able to serve one another freely, and be able to help one another move forward.”

Fifth, businesses expect Washington to produce results, and are ready to engage with political leaders to get things done. There was little tolerance for gridlock and gamesmanship. Most businesspeople described themselves as practical, nonpartisan, and solution-oriented—and they expect more of that in the nation’s capital.

A business owner in Atlanta complained: “Inertia and stalemate really does not help the economy outside the Beltway. We’re looking for lawmakers to get back to the table, to find some bipartisan consensus, and to find areas in public policy where we can move forward.”

There was strong and united support among the businesses we talked to for a public policy agenda to spur economic growth. It’s main elements include: enacting regulatory relief and regulatory reform; producing more American energy; making America’s infrastructure the best in the world; reforming our tax, legal, and immigration systems; selling more American goods and services abroad; improving education and training; expanding access to capital, especially to smaller companies; and renewing our country’s culture of innovation.

The Chamber is delivering the voice of business in Washington on the most important challenge facing the country—how to get our economy moving again.

The businesses we talked to are the people our leaders in Washington should be listening to. They are the doers and the dreamers, and the engines of economic growth.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Brady Skjei goes into the corner with The Post’s Steve Serby to talk about Rangers-Senators, life as a rookie, and more:

Q: What do you like best about this team?

A: I think our speed and skill. When we’re putting our speed on display, that’s when I think we’re at our best. We aren’t the team that’s gonna out-physical a team. We don’t have any guys that are real enforcers. But when we play with our speed, we’re a pretty scary team to play against. It was also nice to see last series that we can play that physical element, too. The whole year that was kind of our knock — (that) we were a soft team, we weren’t physical. Our series in Montreal was the most physical series in the playoffs.

Q: A quick scouting report on you?

A: I’d say good skater. It’s probably my No. 1 asset is my skating ability … can make a good first pass and can make plays in the offensive zone and is reliable in the D zone and can play a physical game.

Q: Ottawa forward Chris Neil?

A: I’m gonna play him just how I play every other forward on their team — try to take away his time and space and just try to play whistle to whistle. He’s gonna want to start stuff after the whistle, and you just gotta let it go and just play the game.

Q: He drove you into the boards and to the ice in December.

A: He kinda hit me from behind into the bench. As a player, you gotta know who you’re out there against. A guy like that’s gonna look to hit you whenever, so gotta protect yourself.

Q: Mats Zuccarello stood up for you.

A: None of us are really fighters, but we all stick up for each other and that’s been a huge thing.

Q: Your mentality on the ice?

A: I would say even-keel. I don’t try to get too high or too low. I play with a little emotion, but nothing that’s gonna take me off my game, I don’t think. I try to play a smart game and use my speed to my advantage.

Q: What drives you?

A: To win a Cup. That’s what really makes me come to the rink every day and want to get better and make our team get better. Winning a Cup would be the ultimate dream.

Q: Do you feel any pressure?

A: I think my whole life I’ve been pretty good at handling pressure. I get more excited than I feel nervous.

Q: The agony of losing in the first round of the playoffs last year against the Penguins?

A: I wasn’t really part of the team, I was there for seven games in the regular season and then all playoffs. Seeing what the guys put in to get to that point and then to have it end like that was tough. This year, being part of the team the whole year has kinda made me realize what it really takes to get to the playoffs, and I don’t want to have that feeling anytime soon here.

Q: What makes Hank (Henrik Lundqvist) Hank?

A: His focus, determination at the rink. It’s amazing how dialed in he is before games.

Q: Zucc?

A: I think his skill set is off the charts. He’s not the biggest guy out there, but you can’t get the puck from him. He always makes the right play, and he’s pretty flashy too sometimes, that can really put you in awe.

Q: Jimmy Vesey?

A: Super skilled. Plays with an edge. Every month that he’s been here, he’s gotten better and better, and now he’s really playing well.

Q: How big a leap do you think you’ve taken since the beginning of the season?

A: I think I’ve gotten a lot more comfortable since the start of the year and more confident.

Q: Do you enjoy playing on the power play?

A: Yeah, I do. It’s a time of the game where you can really make another team pay, and I like trying to be that guy that can set up a play to get a goal.

Q: Ryan McDonagh is your guy.

A: We play similar games. We’re both pretty good skaters, left-handed shots, from Minnesota. Went the college hockey route and then both play here. I try to be a sponge around him, soak up as much as I can. He’s just an elite defenseman in this league, so whatever he tells me, I’m gonna listen to.

Q: What’s it like having Vesey as a roommate?

A: It’s fun. It’s nice that we are both rookies this year. We’re kinda going through it all together. It makes it better when you got someone to talk to or someone to hang out with. You don’t feel alone.

Q: Why do you enjoy living in TriBeCa?

A: It’s quiet. It’s kind of a family atmosphere place. There are a lot of families and young kids.

Q: Favorite restaurants?

A: ABC Kitchen and American Cut.

Q: Favorite NYC things?

A: I like going to SoHo, like that area, walking around on an off day. I like Central Park. I just kinda like exploring a little bit, just taking the subway to wherever.

Q: Boyhood idol?

A: Niklas Lidstrom. I love the way he played. … He’s just so good defensively and so good offensively.

Q: Boyhood dream?

A: To play in the NHL. I always wanted to play high school hockey and then go play for the Minnesota Gophers. To make it to the NHL was the main dream.

Q: If you could pick the brain of any player in history, who would you pick?

A: Maybe Gretzky. The stuff he did was incredible. All the things he accomplished, it’d be pretty amazing to listen to. Last year, I lived with Ryan Bourque in Hartford, and obviously his dad’s Ray Bourque, and getting to pick his brain was a pretty cool thing. He always gave me advice after games, so I took that advice and definitely ran with it.

Q: What was the best piece of advice he gave you?

A: He said he went to practice every day and competed like it was his last day.

Q: You played quarterback in high school.

A: Up until my sophomore year. I went to Ann Arbor my junior year, so I just quit playing.

Q: Which quarterbacks did you like watching?

A: Cam Newton. I liked the guys that could run, like Johnny Manziel, like those guys.

Q: Were you a decent quarterback?

A: I was pretty good, yeah. I was like a rollout passer. I was pretty mobile. I wasn’t really a pocket passer.

Q: Athletes in other sports you admire?

A: Football: Tom Brady, just the mental side of the game he plays with. I think he has that “it” factor, that clutch gene that people have. Basketball: It’s amazing what LeBron can do with his size and his ability. Baseball: I’d say Jeter, off the field how he never really had a mess-up in his whole career. Golf: My favorite player’s probably Jordan Spieth.

Celebrating 4 years together in Turks ???????? A post shared by Brady Skjei (@bradyskjei) on Jan 9, 2017 at 5:15pm PST

Q: How good a golfer are you?

A: Pretty good, played on my high school varsity team. Probably 2- or 3-handicap. My parents’ house is on a golf course, so I was always playing the sport.

Q: Game-day routine or superstitions?

A: I always get an iced coffee when we’re home. I get a peanut butter bagel before the game, and then usually play soccer with the guys before warm-ups.

Q: Who’s the best soccer player?

A: Zucc.

Q: Your girlfriend, Gracia?

A: We grew up next-door neighbors. We didn’t start dating until freshman year in college. She’s a nurse at NYU right now.

Q: Tell me how Sam Rosen likes his coffee from Dunkin’ Donuts.

A: (Laughs) I think he gets just straight black with maybe a little bit of milk. Me and Jimmy take the subway to the game, and if we see Sam we always treat him with a coffee.

Q: Are you recognized on the subway?

A: Maybe once every subway trip, but nothing crazy.

Q: That’s the beauty of New York, you can kind of blend in, right?

A: Yeah, exactly.

Q: How would you describe what it’s like being a New York Ranger?

A: You feel honored … really want to bring a Cup to this city. That’s a huge thing for me.

Q: You’re not even from this city.

A: I know, but being here for a year-and-a-half, you see how many people really are diehard Ranger fans and they really put a lot of time and effort in watching us. To give them a Cup and also fulfill a lifelong dream would be pretty cool.

Q: You have no idea how this city embraces winners.

A: I don’t, not yet. Hopefully soon.

Q: Can this team make a serious run at a Cup?

A: I believe so. I think we have all the tools to do it.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Welcome back, Dax.

The Red Bulls say hello again to Dax McCarty as the beloved former captain brings a retooled Chicago Fire — together with German legend Bastian Schweinsteiger — into Red Bull Arena on Saturday night (7 pm; MSG).

McCarty returns to New York for the first time since his shocking trade to Chicago in the offseason, and Red Bulls head coach Jesse Marsch expects it to be an emotional night.

“It’ll be hard to see [McCarty] on the other side of the field,” said Marsch, whose team is coming off an impressive 2-0 win against Columbus. “I think it’ll be a big moment for our fans to show appreciation towards him for all the years he played here and what he’s meant to the club.”

McCarty left the Red Bulls with a sour taste in his mouth after spending nearly six seasons with the team, including being the face behind two Supporters’ Shields (2013, 2015). But McCarty has given life to Chicago, one-time bottom dwellers of the East, by recording two assists in the young season. Schweinsteiger, the former World Cup winner who signed as a Designated Player from Manchester United, also has been a major addition, scoring two goals while helping Chicago pick up seven points in his four games.

“This is a different Chicago than we’ve faced before,” Red Bulls goalkeeper Luis Robles said. “They have some very good technical players, they have some difference makers, and of course, they have a familiar face.”

The matchup marks the beginning of a crucial three-game stretch for the Red Bulls in just a week: Chicago, at Kansas City, at Philadelphia. With about a quarter of the season in the books, if the Red Bulls can pick up points in all three matches, they’ll be sitting pretty in the East. Marsch plans to roll out his best lineup against Chicago, but alluded to tapping into resources on the bench.

“We feel like our weapons are ready to go. Off the bench, I think we can be very effective,” Marsch said.

The Red Bulls, who haven’t lost in 18 home matches, expect Sal Zizzo to be ready Saturday. Forward Mike Grella, who is battling a knee injury, could appear sometime next week.

“It’s going to be an important week,” Marsch said. “We’ll make sure we have everyone ready to go.”</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>“Sometimes people tell me I look familiar and I say, ‘You must watch a lot of porn’. They always think I’m joking.”

But Ryan James isn’t joking. The Australian escort, porn star, and certified personal trainer has appeared in roughly 150 XXX-rated films and he was more than happy to reveal to News.com.au exactly what life is like as a male porn star.

From how much he gets paid to whether or not he needs “help” getting it up, here’s what the $375-per-hour escort had to say:

Do you get sent a script before you start filming?

It’s usually much more disorganized than that. I usually know who I’m working with but in terms of what’s actually going to happen in the scene, we generally don’t know. Sometimes we make it up on the spot. I remember one time we were just sitting around and everyone was hungry so we ordered some pizza and we were trying to figure out what to do for the next scene. Then someone just came up with the idea to make the scene about a pizza delivery boy because we already had the boxes there. It’s not very well planned most of the time. But people aren’t really watching for the story anyway.

Do you know most of your co-stars?

In Australia, the porn community is quite small. A lot of the time I’m working with friends who I’ve known for years. It can go from being a purely platonic friendship to working with them and then back to being friends. It’s a job to have sex with them but outside of the scene you just go back to being friends.

How do you prepare before a shoot?

These days I don’t really do anything to prepare. I get told when and where to turn up and I just make sure I’ve got my bag packed with anything I might need, maybe a few outfits and lube, because that’s not always provided.

Do you take any ‘pills’ before a shoot?

Nearly all men who do porn do [take pills]. If someone is saying they don’t they’re probably lying. A lot of guys watch porn and think, ‘I’d never need to take anything because it’s easy to have sex with hot girls.’ But the reality is, if they had a chance to do a film, they’d find they can’t perform without it.

How many people are on set during filming?

On average it might be two or three, but I’ve had anywhere from none if it’s a POV [point of view] scene … up to 10 people watching.

Does the director give you instructions during scenes?

A lot of the time they just let you do what you want to do. You might have a dry run first where they take photos to put up on the website. In the photos you run through the different positions and then when it comes time to do the actual filming, they tell you to go through the same positions from the photos.

At the other end of the spectrum, it’s multiple cameras and multiple angles and the director will tell you very specifically what they want from you.

How long are the shoots?

The actual filming can go from anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. The average would be about 30 minutes. With Australian companies, they’ll just try and film for half an hour straight and then they’ll edit it down a bit.

In terms of actually being on set, I think my record was 11 hours for one scene. That was in Europe and they were a little bit disorganized and they took a lot of time to set up the cameras and fill out forms and do makeup. Most of that 11 hours was me just sitting there doing nothing.

‘People do recognize me, a lot of the time they don’t say anything because they might feel a bit awkward about saying, ‘Hey, I’ve seen your penis on film.’’

In Australia, how much would you get paid for one scene?

For one scene, which is, say, a 15 to 20-minute movie, up to $600.

What’s the most uncomfortable scene you’ve filmed?

The one scene where I felt most out of place was in Europe. It was my first time filming there. We drove for seven hours from Budapest to Prague and turned up at this place which was decked out like a nightclub. The scene we were doing, which I didn’t really know beforehand, was 50 people in a nightclub. Basically, it was a huge orgy. There was an open bar, a DJ, a dance floor. There were about 35 girls, 15 guys and five people walking around with cameras. I had no idea what I was doing there.

Do you ever watch back the videos you’ve starred in?

I can’t. I’ve tried to watch them before but I just can’t do it.

Do you ever get recognized in public?

Not very often and I think if people do recognize me, a lot of the time they don’t say anything because they might feel a bit awkward about saying, “Hey, I’ve seen your penis on film.” Sometimes people tell me I look familiar and I say, “You must watch a lot of porn then.” They always think I’m joking.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>http://nypost.com/2017/05/02/our-bets-for-the-2017-tony-race/</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>We are off and running with the Tony nominations, announced Tuesday, and while it’s easy to predict some of the winners, a lot of categories are up for grabs.

“Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812” led the field with 12 nominations, including Best Musical, Best Actor in a Musical (Josh Groban), Best Actress (Denée Benton) and Best Original Score, Book and Direction (Rachel Chavkin).

The other nominees for Best Musical are “Groundhog Day,” “Dear Evan Hanson” and “Come From Away.”

The hit revival of “Hello, Dolly!” grabbed 10 nominations, among them Best Revival of a Musical, Best Actress (the divine Bette Midler), Actor (the divine David Hyde Pierce), Best Direction (the divine Jerry Zaks) and Best Featured Performers — Gavin Creel and Kate Baldwin, both, well, divine.

The nominees for Best Play are “Oslo,” a surprisingly riveting historical drama about Middle East peace talks in the 1990s; “A Doll’s House, Part 2,” a snappy comedy inspired by a not-very-snappy Henrik Ibsen classic; “Sweat,” this year’s Pulitzer Prize winner; and “Indecent,” Paula Vogel’s gripping take on the controversy surrounding a lesbian-themed play from the 1920s.

The nominators thumbed their noses at several high-profile productions, causing considerable anger, fear and dyspepsia in Shubert Alley today.

“War Paint,” a musical about the rivalry between cosmetic queens Elizabeth Arden and Helena Rubinstein, scooped up nominations for leading ladies Christine Ebersole and Patti LuPone, but was shut out of Best Musical, Best Book, Best Score and Best Director.

The show is selling well and will be fine as long as its two divas are above the title. But the snub for Best Musical ripped the cucumbers off the eyes of its creators and investors.

As for “Hello, Dolly!” it was unbeatable in 1964, and it’s unbeatable in 2017.

“Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, “Anastasia” “A Bronx Tale,” Bandstand” and “Amélie” were shunned as well.

“Bandstand” and “Amélie” are doomed. They didn’t sell any tickets before they opened, they didn’t sell any tickets after they opened, and they’re sure as hell not going to sell any tickets now.

“A Bronx Tale” was never going to be a favorite with Broadway insiders, but it has wide appeal with suburbanites and tourists, so it will run for a bit. “Anastasia” and “Charlie” have healthy advance ticket sales and should be able to scoop up the family business in the summer. They’re never going to be “The Lion King” or “Cats,” but they’ll have respectable runs and decent national tours.

Nominators also snubbed Andrew Lloyd Webber, shunning his revival of “Cats” and his terrific revival of “Sunset Boulevard,” starring Glenn Close, who was not in the running for an award because she already won a Tony playing Norma Desmond in 1995.

In addition to “Dolly!” the nominees for Best Revival of a Musical are “Falsettos,” which had a limited run, and “Miss Saigon.”

A surprising snub was for Lloyd Webber’s orchestrations for “Sunset.” The show has a 41-piece orchestra, and why those soaring melodies, re-orchestrated by Lloyd Webber, did not land with the nominators is a mystery.

Where do the horse races stand right now?

“A Doll’s House, Part 2” is creeping up on “Oslo.” It’s only 90 minutes long as opposed to the three-hour running time for “Oslo” — and Tony voters like an early dinner. “Oslo” has the mantle of importance, but there’s a friskiness to “Doll’s House” that just might carry it over the finish line.

“Sweat,” despite its Pulitzer, is a long shot. It’s struggling at the box office, done in by the rivalry between New York Times chief critic Ben Brantley and his ex-colleague Charles Isherwood, who was fired from the Times earlier this year. Isherwood raved about the play when it debuted off-Broadway last year, but Brantley gave it the back of his hand when it opened last month at Studio 54. Brantley’s knock was widely seen as his way of wiping away any traces of Isherwood’s influence.

Isherwood is going after the Times for wrongful termination, and his upcoming arbitration hearing promises to be more exciting than this year’s Tony Awards.

The race for Best Actor in a Musical is between Ben Platt (“Dear Evan Hansen”) and Andy Karl (“Groundhog Day”). Both are terrific and extremely popular on Broadway. The race is going to teeter-totter right up until June 11, but I’ll give the upper hand to Karl. One, because he deserves it. And, two, because “Groundhog Day” is not going to win Best Musical, so Karl’s Tony will be something of a consolation prize.

A side note: Pierce, who won a Tony for “Curtains” in 2007, insisted on being nominated as Best Actor in “Hello, Dolly!” so that his co-star Creel would have a shot at winning Best Supporting Actor.

The Tony Award for class goes to Pierce.

Despite its 12 nominations, “Natasha and Pierre” has no chance of winning Best Musical. The race is between “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Come From Away,” a musical about 9/11 that has audiences weeping and then cheering. “Evan Hansen” has fans — and a lot of Tony voters have money in the show. But “Come From Away” has quietly gained momentum and will soon be unstoppable.

As for “Hello, Dolly!” it was unbeatable in 1964, and it’s unbeatable in 2017.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Carl’s Jr. used sexy models to sell burgers for years.

But will barely dressed ladies help sell off some prime Los Angeles real estate?

Former movie producer-turned-real estate developer Nile Niami certainly hope so. The Hollywood mogul is now selling his famed Beverly Hills estate, Opus.

The home is a whopping 20,500 square feet and features seven bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, two pools, numerous water features, a champagne vault (which has a special section that holds up to 170 bottles of Cristal), a home theater and even a beauty salon.

All of these over-the-top amenities are featured in a new sales video for the property, that, according to TMZ, Niami himself had a hand in creating.

In the video, barely dressed gilded ladies parade around the house, showing off its numerous features.

The women in the video obviously aren’t for sale but the property does come with two luxury cars in the 10-car museum-garage– a gold Lamborghini Aventador and a Rolls-Royce Dawn.

Opus is listed at $100 million. Listing agent Drew Fenton of Hilton & Hyland also oversaw the $100 million sale of the Playboy Mansion last summer.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>The Rangers’ momentum was long gone. Their dominant performance two days earlier didn’t mean anything anymore.

The first period of Game 4 was scoreless, and Madison Square Garden was quiet and curious, anxiously waiting to see how long the battle with the Senators would remain a stalemate.

No one knew what was coming next. Certainly, no one knew it would come from Nick Holden.

Holden, who had scored just one goal in the previous 21 games, swung control of the game — and potentially the series — to the Rangers after scoring the game’s first goal, putting his team ahead for good in their 4-1 series-tying win over Ottawa on Thursday night.

“When you get that first goal, it helps your team grab a little more momentum and that’s kind of what we did,” Holden said.

The long-struggling Rangers defenseman had been having a brutal first postseason in New York, only creating headlines when he didn’t want them.

When he broke his stick in Game 2 of the first-round series against Montreal, it allowed the Canadiens to score the game-tying goal in the final minute, and eventually win in overtime. In Game 3 against Montreal, Holden was designated a healthy scratch for the first time all season.

Though Holden returned in the next game, and has remained in the lineup ever since, he anonymously skated through most shifts — until turning an innocent-looking possession into a goal that set the Garden ablaze.

Picking up the puck at the red line late in the first period, the 29-year-old delivered a pass to Kevin Hayes, then continued skating down the left side and received a pretty pass back from Hayes in front of the net. Holden then made a nifty deke and patiently waited for goalie Craig Anderson to provide an opening, lifting the puck above his right pad to give the Rangers the lead with 5:56 left in the first period. It was the fourth straight game of the series that the Rangers scored the first goal.

“I was lucky to pull it back,” Holden said of his move. “Sometimes I try in practice and usually it doesn’t work, but fortunately tonight it did.”

Holden, who had three goals and an assist in seven games with the Avalanche during his only other playoff appearance in 2014, entered Game 4 with a minus-four rating in the playoffs this year, but he posted a plus-one rating Thursday night.

Holden was also stellar where he’s needed most, finishing second among Rangers defensemen in ice time (19:42), while recording the second-most hits on the team (six), and adding three blocked shots.

“We’re pushing the pace and making sure we’re getting pucks deep, and trying to slow down their top guys,” Holden said. “I think we did a good job of that and sticking to our game from start to finish.”</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Performances by Maroon 5, the Alabama Shakes, and Usher & The Roots brought crowd-pleasing rock, blues and R&B to the second day of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, while jazz clarinetist Pete Fountain earned a special place in the event’s history.

Fountain, a festival favorite who died Aug. 6 at the age of 86, was recognized Saturday with the unveiling of a larger-than-life hand-painted portrait in the ancestor area, memorializing those who have helped shape the festival since it began in 1970.

“Welcome back, Pete,” said Quint Davis, director and producer of the festival, as the portrait was unveiled.

“There’s been Fats Domino. There has been Mahalia Jackson. There has been Louis Armstrong,” Davis said. “There have been very few great, great men who have carried the banner of New Orleans around the world through music. And one of those men is Pete Fountain.”

Kicking off with “Lily of the Valley,” members of the Half Fast Marching Club, which Fountain founded, and the Storyville Stompers Brass Band led a second-line there from the Economy Hall Tent, where Fountain last performed in 2013.

Two other “ancestors” also are being honored this year.

Gospel singer Jo “Cool” Davis, who died Aug. 5, 2016, will be celebrated Sunday at 1:30 p.m. with an a cappella performance by The Zion Harmonizers. Zydeco musician Stanley “Buckwheat” Dural Jr., who died Sept. 24, 2016, will be honored May 6 with a parade at 11:45 a.m. and a performance by Zydeco accordionist Nathan Williams Jr.

NOLA.com/The Times-Picayune reports the wooden painting of Fountain was draped in gold.

“We want to thank you Quint for honoring Pete as an ancestor. He’s here with some great friends,” said Benny Harrell, Fountain’s son-in-law and longtime manager.

Davis corrected Harrell warmly: “Thank you Benny, but you’ve really got that backward. It’s an honor for the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival to have been associated with Pete Fountain.”

The seven-day festival takes place over two weekends. In addition to the big-name acts, the festival features hundreds of Louisiana jazz, gospel, zydeco and other musical acts.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Anthony Heald (left) and Anthony Hopkins in Jonathan Demme's 1991 Oscar winner 'The Silence of the Lambs.' (Photo: Ken Regan)

The late director Jonathan Demme's resume was marked with obvious hits and interesting gems.

For those who want to remember his life in movies, here are the five best films to watch:

'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991)

Demme's signature mainstream blockbuster was the first — and thus far, only — horror-leaning thriller to win best picture at the Academy Awards and is one of the most memorable and quotable movies of the 1990s. The first meeting between serial-killing cannibal Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) and FBI agent Clarice Starling is a classic (A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti), though Hannibal getting wheeled out, chained and masked for everyone's safety, is one of Hollywood's most chilling and iconic scenes.

'Philadelphia' (1993)

Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington in a movie about the AIDS epidemic? Come on, movies don't get more Oscar-baity than that, but Demme crafted an extremely emotional and gripping narrative about a man (Hanks) fired from his law firm because of his HIV diagnosis — with Washington as the homophobic lawyer who represents him — that's just as timely today as it was 24 years ago.

'Rachel Getting Married' (2008)

Demme let Anne Hathaway go to town with a trainwreck tour de force as Kym, a recovering drug addict who's given leave from rehab so she can attend her sister's wedding. Tensions arise in the family, a tragedy is revisited, and bad feelings reach a boiling point at the rehearsal dinner when Kym tries to apologize for her checkered past in front of the collected relatives.

'Stop Making Sense' (1984)

Demme did a bunch of conventional Hollywood fare, but he also made some interesting movies in the musical vein, shooting documentaries and concert films with Kenny Chesney, Justin Timberlake and Neil Young. His first was still the best: Stop Making Sense, in which Demme was able to brilliantly capture David Byrne's quirky genius.

'Caged Heat' (1974)

It's always interesting to see an iconic filmmaker's earliest work, and Demme's debut came at the height of the women-in-prison exploitation genre. It also happened to be the best thing to come out of these bad but good B-movie flicks, as Demme tweaked the genre — having a female warden, for example — while also adding a feminist and socially conscious bent.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Pope Francis waves to worshippers before the start of a mass in Cairo. (Photo: Andreas Solaro, AFP/Getty Images)

CAIRO — Pope Francis led a mass for thousands of Egyptians on Saturday, telling followers that the only acceptable kind of fanaticism is that of charity.

Any other type of fanaticism does not come from God, and is not pleasing to him,” Francis told tens of thousands of Catholics and Copts at a suburban Cairo stadium. True faith is one that makes us more charitable, more merciful, more honest and more humane — it moves our hearts to love everyone without counting the cost, without distinction and without preference … it makes us see the other not as an enemy to be overcome but a brother or sister to be loved, served and helped.”

The pope's message of unity is one of the main themes of a two-day visit to Egypt to promote tolerance, peace and dialogue with Muslims in the Arab's world's largest country. The visit also comes after Coptic Christian churches were bombed on Palm Sunday, killing at least 44 people and injuring scores more.

Many in that community were joyful to welcome the pope as he entered the stadium to a show of yellow and white balloons, and a chorus singing Gloria as Francis waved to the crowds.

“Francis is telling us that we are his sons,” said Jozef Mata, 23, an Egyptian social worker who is one of the 250,000 Catholics in the country. “He will take care of us whatever the cost.”

Mata took a four-hour bus ride from his home in Assiut in central Egypt and slept on the floor of the De La Salle High School in Cairo the night before Francis' morning mass in the city’s Air Defense Stadium.

The mass comes on the last day of Francis' visit to the African nation. On Thursday, he became the first pope to visit Al-Azhar University, a center of Sunni Islamic scholarship that dates back to the 10th century. He also met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and visited a Coptic church bombed by Islamic State in December.

Around 25,000 Catholics and others were slated to attend the mass. Coptic, Greek Orthodox and other Christian leaders were also expected, said Father Rafik Greish, the head of the Information Office of the Egyptian Catholic Church.

“They will have seats of honor and be wearing their turbans and robes but will not be taking part in the Eucharist,” he said.

Meanwhile, pharmacy clerk Mohammed Ahmed, 40, welcomed the pontiff’s visit as an acknowledgment that most Egyptians don’t sympathize with the Islamic State and other jihadists.

The pope's visit is a blessing for all Egyptians,” Ahmed said. “He will improve and increase the view of Egypt abroad and is a sending message that Egypt is safe.





We feel bad that these church bombings are happening,” he added. “But this is the result of people like the Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey and (Palestinian) Hamas that have brought so many weapons to extremists through the Sinai desert.

Francis appeared to endorse this view on Friday at the Al-Azhar University, when he condemned the flow of money and weapons destined to those who provoke violence.

The most populous Arab country, Egypt is majority Muslim. Around 10% of its 92 million citizens are Copts, making them the largest Christian community in the Middle East.

Francis met with the spiritual head of the Copts, Pope Tawadros on Friday, pledging that one church would not re-baptize those who converted from one faith to the other. The measure has intense symbolic significance because it means the Vatican and Coptic Churches now respect how each performs the sacrament.

Peter Basilious, a 28-year-old Coptic pharmacist, said Francis’ visit would draw Rome and the Coptic Christian Church closer.

This is about high-level politics – promoting peace between Muslim and Christians but also looking for a real connection to the Egyptian Orthodox leaders,” Basilious said. “Francis is showing he loves our church and wants a unified approach to our faith.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Bill Simmons said it took 10 years for him to land both South Park Creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, on his podcast, and it was certainly worth the wait. The episode was funny, informative and enlightening - and it even featured some Tom Brady bashing from the two lifelong Denver Broncos

Before Pats fans get too upset: Trey Parker, the one making the comment, was only joking around, and it really was rather funny. It started when Simmons talked about the time he visited the studio, only to find the men working on the Deflategate scene below.

You guys were being mean to [Tom Brady], I felt like I had blood on my hands, Simmons said. Now you feel bad because he was exonerated…Trey lost the argument, there was no evidence and you besmirched a great man.

The clip contains some NSFW language:

That's when the two began winding-up Simmons around the 37 minute mark:

He's a dirty, lying cheater. A dirty, lying cheater.

Matt added:

Deflategate bummed out Trey more than anything I've ever seen. Just like, the Statue of Liberty of football just crying. You just see this loss of innocence.

The tongue-in-cheek conversation came about again at the very end of the show, around the 1:18:17 mark.

If you guys do anything to [expletive] with Brady with like, movie or music I'm going to be really upset, Simmons said, to which the two men responded:

Oh no, we are. We have a great Tom Brady and Belichick joke. We wrote a great song called, 'liar, liar, pants on fire.' He'll have some burning pants on.

Richard Ray, Realtor with John Daugherty, Realtors, is a seasoned and award-winning real estate professional who has been providing top-notch personal service to his clients for more than a decade.

He has seen the real estate market fluctuate over the years. Yet, this year could be his best.

When 2017 began, I had no idea it would be my best year ever in my 13-year career. Last year was full of ups and downs, and turns and twists. It was a challenging year, Ray said.

However, this year is off to a great start as buyers are more confidence and inventory is up.

It is a blessing to be selling real estate in Houston right now. It is great to be working with renters who are turning into buyers, buyers who are turning into sellers and first-time home buyers who are turning into second-home buyers. I believe our best years are still ahead, Ray said.

Ray goes where his clients want to go, and he works hard and long hours to meet their goals, all of which takes energy.

I get up at 3:30 a.m., respond to emails, review listings, hit the gym, return home, feed the dog, get dressed and then I'm ready for the day, whatever it brings. In this market, you must be ready to go at a moment's notice, show a home, meet clients and be at your best. And I am, he said.

This daily preparation, his excellent communication skills, experience, and striving to go the extra mile for his clients have led to him receiving many awards and honors, as well as total client satisfaction.

He also receives referrals from satisfied clients.

Ray is also able to help his clients through the process, not only because he is experienced and knowledgeable, but also because he has personally gone through the process many times. He has been buying and selling real estate for over 20 years as an investor. So, he has been on both sides of the table, which means he can relate to clients going through the process.

He also has renovated numerous properties, so he knows construction and the details of a home. With an eye for quality and extensive experience, Ray is able to offer his clients added value throughout the process. He also has a degree in accounting, so he knows the numbers - a benefit during negotiations.</td>

“I don’t think I could have won as a Republican…As an Independent, I started getting calls — ‘Joe you’re going to disrupt the Republicans, the Democrats are worried…I’m not an obstructionist,” he told FOX Business’ Neil Cavuto on Cavuto: Coast to Coast.

Piscopo, widely known for portraying legendary singer Frank Sinatra on SNL in the 1980s, also discussed why he is standing behind Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno as the Republican candidate in the race.

“It was magnanimous, it was the right thing to do and we are going to unify New Jersey...I’m doing what’s right for the people of Jersey; it’s bigger than any one person…I think she’s a great girl, she’s her own woman and it was very very refreshing and we support her now,” he said.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Playboy has announced Brook Power as the 2017 Playmate of the Year.

The Hawaii-based model is featured on the cover of Playboy’s May/June 2017 issue, which highlights an 11-page pictorial shot by French fashion and beauty photographer David Bellemere.

“We’re excited to announce that Brook Power is our Playmate of the Year for 2017,” said Playboy Creative Director Chis Deacon in an official release sent to Fox News. “She is the epitome of a free-spirit — cool, creative and confident, all while balancing a unique personality with extraordinary beauty.”

'HARRY POTTER' ACTRESS STRIPS DOWN FOR PLAYBOY

Power, who grew up on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, first appeared in the men’s magazine as the May 2016 Playmate of the Month. She is Playboy’s 58th Playmate of the Year, and the first Native American Playmate to be given the iconic title. Playboy named its first Playmate of the Year, Ellen Stratton, in 1960.

Power was proud to show off her famous assets for the publication, which featured the model in a tropical setting.

“I probably feel the most beautiful when I’m surfing at home in Hawaii,” she told Playboy. “That sounds so cheesy, but having that life force surrounding you and the water on your skin, moving under your feet, you definitely feel powerful, as though you’ve harnessed this great natural energy. You’re not just a spectator — you’re making it even more beautiful by being there.”

Power also added that she felt at ease going topless for the magazine.

“I actually didn’t feel as though the two were very different — well, that’s not true,” she said on the differences between posting nude and clothed for Playboy. “David Bellemere, the photographer for my Playmate of the Year shoot, is French, so he thinks being naked all the time is not a big deal. But other than that, it’s the same style of photography. It’s modern. It’s current.”

<td class='normal' valign='top'>http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/05/01/fate-furious-reigns-supreme-at-box-office-surpasses-1b-mark.html</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>A South India sensation, a Hispanic-focused comedy and the highest-grossing film ever directed by an African American made up the top three films in North America on a culturally diverse box office weekend.

As expected, it was another runaway weekend for The Fate of the Furious, which took No. 1 for the third straight week with $19.4 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Universal Pictures release also throttled past $1 billion globally, and passed its predecessor, Furious 7, to become the highest-grossing imported film in China with $361 million.

The Fast and the Furious franchise, the latest of which is helmed by F. Gary Gray, has always been held up as a model of the diverse blockbuster, given its cast led by Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. But the smaller films that trailed it over the weekend also reflected the box-office might of often underserved audiences.

In second domestically with $12 million and drawing an overwhelmingly Hispanic crowd was Eugenio Derbez's comedy, How to Be a Latin Lover. The film is easily the biggest success yet for Pantelion, the Latino-oriented joint venture of Lionsgate and Grupo Televisa.

How to Be a Latin Lover co-stars Salma Hayek, Rob Lowe and Kristen Bell. But its top draw is Derbez, whose Instructions Not Included was the highest-grossing Spanish-language film in North America in 2013. The audience for How to be a Latin Lover was 89 percent Hispanic.

In third was Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, a so-called Tollywood (Telugu language) film from South India, which pulled in a remarkable $10.1 million despite playing on just 420 screens. (The Fate of the Furious played on more than 4,000.)

Baahubali 2 even bested a pair of Hollywood's biggest stars in Emma Watson and Tom Hanks. Their terribly reviewed thriller The Circle, distributed by STX Films on behalf of EuropaCorp, opened with $9.3 million.

Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore, said such global weekends at the box office will become more common.

In what is a slow and would otherwise be unremarkable weekend, this is a really interesting lineup of films, said Dergarabedian. This is the final weekend before the summer season kicks off and the blockbusters hit theaters. But this weekend is marked by an incredible amount of multicultural content. It reflects the world that we're living in.

Baahubali 2 follows the 2015 original that set box-office records in India, a breakthrough for a non-Hindi film. The 2015 film grossed $9.3 million in the U.S. and more than $100 million worldwide. With $1.8 million on domestic IMAX screens, a record for a foreign language film on IMAX, Baahubali 2 may break more records.

Its success isn't surprising to everyone.

We were expecting exactly the numbers we're seeing right now. We're happy our expectations were right, said Soma Kancherla of the film's North American distributor, Great India Films. I know for a few people they're like, 'Wow,' but to break even, we needed to make that kind of money.

The summer movie season begins next week with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. With the Marvel behemoth on deck, few new films were released in an otherwise quiet weekend.

Disney's Guardians of the Galaxy sequel began its international rollout over the weekend, opening in 37 territories ahead of its North American debut. It earned an estimated $101.2 million, a promising start for what's expected to be one of the summer's biggest hits.

Guardians will likely be the third $1 billion movie in 2017, following Beauty and the Beast and The Fate of the Furious. Disney said Vol. 2 is running 57 percent ahead of the pace of the original, which made $773.3 million in 2014.

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers also are included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

1. The Fate of the Furious, $19.4 million ($68.4 million international).

2. How to Be a Latin Lover, $12 million.

3. Baahubali 2: The Conclusion, $10.1 million ($3.7 million international).

4. The Circle, $9.3 million.

5. The Boss Baby, $9.1 million ($15.5 million international).

6. Beauty and the Beast, $6.4 million ($17.2 million international).

Michael Cimarusti (Providence and Connie and Ted’s), Jeremy Fox (Rustic Canyon Wine Bar and Seasonal Kitchen), Ludo Lefebvre (Trois Mec, Petit Trois, Trois Familia) and Travis Lett (Gjelina and Gjusta), four chefs who have contributed greatly to elevating L.A.’s dining scene, were all nominated for Best Chef West. (All four of these L.A. chefs are fixtures on Jonathan Gold's list of 101 Best Restaurants.) The award went to Corey Lee of Benu in San Francisco.

Margarita Manzke of Republique, nominated for Outstanding Pastry Chef, was edged out by Ghaya Oliveria of Daniel in New York City. Caroline Styne of the Lucques Group (Lucques, A.O.C., Tavern, etc.) was nominated for Outstanding Restaurateur; the award went to Stephen Starr of the Philadelphia-based Starr Restaurants.

The night wasn’t a complete loss for the Los Angeles industry, as Suzanne Goin of the Lucques Group (Lucques, A.O.C., Tavern, etc.) and Evan Kleiman, host of KCRW’s “Good Food” and frequent contributor to The Times food section, were named inductees into the James Beard Foundation Who’s Who of Food and Beverage in America.

Last year, L.A. restaurants fared far better at the awards, with Goin winning Outstanding Chef, Dahlia Narvaez of Mozza winning Outsanding Pastry Chef and Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo of Jon & Vinny’s, Animal and Son of a Gun taking home the title of Best Chef West.

Here’s to hoping this city’s great, hardworking chefs get a little more recognition next year.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Los Angeles on Saturday marks Earth Day by opening vital green space in the city’s heart and, in so doing, reclaiming historic roots that for a century lay forgotten under freight yards and industrial pollution.

The new Los Angeles State Historic Park occupies acreage just north of Chinatown between the L.A. River and the Elysian Hills, where pobladores who journeyed from Mexico and later arrivals from Europe, Asia and the United States drew their water. It was where, beginning in 1876, a generation of migrants from points east ended their rail sojourns to California, disembarking at the Southern Pacific Railroad’s River Station. With the dawn of the 20th century, it was where the town became an industrial city as the depot, restaurants and hotels gave way to rail yards and switching stations. It became known as the Cornfields, although there was scant evidence that corn ever grew there.

Years later, when the railroad moved out, the city was left with a vacated and valuable swath of flat land that city leaders were ready to turn into a sterile expanse of warehouses. Fortunately, community activists and open-space advocates saw the land’s potential as the key link in a chain of green, open space that could one day run through the region alongside the river. The state came up with some money for a park, and after more than a decade of fits and starts — and an art project called Not a Cornfield (including an actual cornfield), plus a succession of music festivals — park development began in earnest three years ago.

Archaeologists using sonar discovered the buried foundations of the train station, the hotel, a roundhouse and other structures crucial to the growth of the city. The new park recaptures the civic memory of those historic buildings by tracing their outlines on the park grounds without infringing on the badly needed stretch of green.

Respect for history also requires L.A. to acknowledge that this is not the first Los Angeles State Historic Park. That distinction belongs to the area around Olvera Street, where the state, city and county tried to jointly manage a handful of historic structures and a somewhat kitschy Mexican marketplace. The arrangement largely failed, and the state pulled out two decades ago.

Now that the new state park is finally opening, let’s hope that it will have a smoother ride. It has enormous potential — to link the city’s burgeoning downtown residential population with the river, with the other former rail yards known as Taylor Yard and the Piggyback Yard, and with the rest of the region, both up and down the river, while providing a sense of history, some relief for the eye and a welcome whiff of fresh air.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Jonathan Demme, right, with Anne Hathaway before a screening of Rachel Getting Married at the 2008 Venice International Film Festival.

The death of Jonathan Demme comes as a shock because his films felt so alive. Seemingly guided by the spirited convictions of his creative generosity, emotional openness and observant, exploratory curiosity, Demme was an exemplar of an artist who refused to be defined as any one thing.

He made fiction features and documentaries, worked in television during a long and eclectic career, and won the Oscar in 1992 for directing The Silence of the Lambs.

The strongest constant in Demme’s work was his unpredictability and a sense of constantly pressing on to something new.

At the same time he never seemed restless in the conventional mode of agitation. He exuded a contradictory sense of energetic enthusiasm and disarming calm that may well have been the key to his work as a collaborator.

Demme brought out the best in his performers, and had a particular eye to the dynamic of couples or pairs, including Paul Le Mat and Mary Steenburgen in 1980’s “Melvin and Howard,” Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith in 1986’s “Something Wild,” Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins in “The Silence of the Lambs,” Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington in 1993’s “Philadelphia” and Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline in his last fiction feature, 2015’s “Ricki and the Flash.”

He likewise brought out fresh, unexpected contours from performers such as Michelle Pfeiffer in 1988’s “Married to the Mob” and Anne Hathaway in 2008’s “Rachel Getting Married.” . . .</td>

The 2017 Tribeca Film Festival came to a close Saturday with the announcement of the two winners for the Audience Awards, sponsored by AT&T.

The Divine Order, directed and written by Petra Volpe, about Swiss suffrage in the 1970s won the narrative award for its tale of Swiss suffeage in the 1970's.

Winning the documentary award was Hondros, which was directed by Greg Campbell and written by Cambell and Jenny Golden, about the life of Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Chris Hondros, who died in Libya in 2011.

It is always exciting to see what resonates most with the audience, and this year both the narrative and documentary winners represent smart filmmaking and impactful storytelling, Paula Weinstein, one of the founders of the festival, said in a statement.

On behalf of the Tribeca team, we congratulate 'The Divine Order' and 'Hondros' as the 2017 Audience Award winners, and hope moviegoers worldwide get to experience these powerful films.

Runners-up for the Audience Awards include Saturday Church directed and written by Damon Cardasis for narrative film and Shadowman directed and written by Oren Jacoby for documentary.

The festival awarded its top jury prizes Thursday, with Rachel Israel's Keep the Change winning the top narrative jury prize.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>The Tribeca Film Festival has given its top U.S. narrative jury prize to Rachel Israel's Keep the Change, a love story about and starring people with autism.

It also handed best international narrative feature to Elina Psykou’s “Son of Sofia” and best documentary feature to “Bobbi Jene” from Elvira Lind.

Israel's film is an offbeat romantic comedy that uses ?nonactors, many on the autism spectrum, to tell its tale; the film is partly set in a New York support group, where an unlikely relationship blossoms. In awarding the prize, the jury issued a statement citing a “world full of vibrant characters often under-represented in cinema” and a “unique yet universal love story told in a way we’ve never seen.”

“Sofia” deals with a young boy who comes from Russia to Greece at the time of the 2004 Athens Olympics. And “Jene” centers on an American dancer who returns home after many years with an Israeli company.

The festival touted the fact that all the major winners were women, including some of the artists behind “Treehugger: Wawona,” which won Tribeca’s digital Storyscapes award.

The fest continues in the coming days with star-laden screenings of Reservoir Dogs and The Godfather,” concerts from the likes of Puffy and Flock of Seagulls and a conversation between Bruce Springsteen and Tom Hanks.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Despite last-ditch efforts, French rap duo PNL won’t appear at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival this weekend.

Last weekend the duo, comprising brothers Tarik and Nabil Andrieu, were forced to pull its gig in the 11th hour because of a visa issue with Tarik.

“After months of administrative procedures, one of the two of us still wasn’t authorized to come back to the United States for the reasons you are probably imagining,” the duo announced last weekend.

There were hopes that the visa would come through in time for the second weekend, but the visa was refused this week, according to the duo.

PNL wanted to play from France and broadcast live to the festival, but that wasn’t an option.

Coachella would have marked the duo's U.S. debut.

The brothers grew up in the Parisian suburb of Corbeil-Essonnes to immigrant parents. Their group name stands for Peace N' Lovés (which translates to peace and money).

Although Tarik and Nabil Andrieu, who perform as Ademo and N.O.S, aren’t overtly political in their music, fans turned to their songs during the 2016 protests in Paris over labor laws. A key slogan during the demonstrations was “Le Monde Ou Rien,” which translates to “the world or nothing” and was the title of a track on the duo’s second album, “Le Monde Chico.”

Despite visa issues keeping the duo from making its American debut, the Andrieus remain undeterred.

“[This] is not what will stop us,” the group said in a statement on Thursday. “On the contrary it gives us even more ambition.”

<td class='normal' valign='top'>http://www.seattletimes.com/business/ap-norc-poll-most-teens-have-taken-social-media-break/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>NEW YORK (AP) — The common stereotype has teens glued to their phones 24-7. But nearly 60 percent of teens in the U.S. have actually taken a break from social media, the bulk of them even voluntarily, a new survey found.

The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research of teens aged 13 to 17 found that most teens value the feeling of connection with friends and family that social media provides. A much smaller number associate it with negative emotions, such as being overwhelmed or needing to always show their best selves.

The survey, released Thursday, found that teens’ social media breaks are typically a week or longer, and boys are more likely to take longer breaks.

Teens were allowed to cite multiple reasons for their breaks. Nearly two-thirds of teens who took a break cited at least one voluntary reason. Amanda Lenhart, the lead researcher and an expert on young people and technology use, said she was surprised by this, as it counters the broader narrative that teens are “handcuffed” to their social media profiles.

Today’s teenagers might not recall a time before social media. MySpace was founded in 2003. Had it survived, it would be 14 years old today. Facebook is a year younger. Instagram launched in 2010. For an adult to understand what it might be like to take a break from social media for someone who grew up with it, consider disconnecting from email, or your phone for a couple weeks.

Voluntary reasons for teens’ breaks included 38 percent who did so because social media was getting in the way of work or school. Nearly a quarter said they were tired of “the conflict and drama” and 20 percent said they were tired of having to keep up with what’s going on.

Nearly half of teens who took a break did so involuntarily. This included 38 percent said it was because their parents took away their phone or computer and 17 percent who said their phone was lost, broken or stolen.

The involuntary break “is sort of its own challenge,” Lenhart said. “They feel that they are missing out, detached from important social relationships (as well as) news and information.”

About 35 percent of teens surveyed said they have not taken a break, citing such worries as missing out and being disconnected from friends. Some said they need social media for school or extracurricular activities.

“I like to see what my friends and family are up to,” said Lukas Goodwin, 14, who uses Instagram and Snapchat every day. He said he took a break from Instagram “a few years ago” but not recently. Now, he says, “I wouldn’t want to take a break from them.”

Among the survey’s other findings:

— Lower income teens were more likely to take social media breaks than their wealthier counterparts, and their breaks tended to last longer. The study points out that educators who use social media in the classroom need to understand that not every teen is online and connected all the time.

— Boys were more likely to feel overloaded with information on social media, while girls were more likely to feel they always have to show the best version of themselves.

— Teens who took breaks typically did so across the board, checking out of Facebook, Snapchat and all other services all at once. And they were no more or less likely to take breaks from social media based on the type of services they use.

— Although they felt relief and were happy to be away from social media for a while, most teens said things went back to how they were before once they returned to social media.

The AP-NORC poll was conducted online and by phone from Dec. 7 to 31. A sample of parents with teenage children was drawn from a probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Parents then gave permission for their children to be interviewed. The panel, AmeriSpeak, is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>TOKYO (AP) — Shares were mixed in Asia after an upbeat day on Wall Street. Weaker than expected China manufacturing data appeared to have a muted impact.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s Nikkei 225 index advanced 0.6 percent to 19,431.66, helped by a weaker yen, which boosts profits for manufacturers. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 0.9 percent to 2,224.81. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong edged a fraction of 0.1 percent lower to 24,606.76 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.3 percent to 3,144.62. Australia’s S&P ASX 200 fell 0.3 percent to 5,940.60, while shares were higher in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.

CHINA MANUFACTURING: The Caixin China purchasing managers survey found Chinese factories slowed production and slashed jobs in April as new orders weakened. The index fell to 50.3 from 51.2 in March, on a scale of 0-100 with readings above 50 indicating expansion. An official survey released earlier showed similar trends. “The latest PMI readings support our view that growth in China peaked at the turn of the year and is now decelerating,” Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary.

WALL STREET: U.S. stocks rose Monday as big technology companies like Apple continued to rally. Investors bought stocks and sold bonds and gold after Congress agreed to a deal that will keep the government operating for the rest of the fiscal year, averting a shutdown, so they bought riskier stocks and sold government bonds, gold, and high-dividend stocks. The VIX, an index that is seen as a measure of the market’s anxiety level, fell to its lowest level since February 2007. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 0.2 percent to 2,388.33. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 20,913.46 as Boeing and IBM lagged. Gains for tech companies pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.7 percent to 6,091.60, another record high.

U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING: The House of Representatives is due to vote Wednesday on a spending bill that would fund most government operations through September. The bill does not include the border wall President Donald Trump has proposed, and rejects his proposed cuts to popular domestic programs.

ANALYST VIEWPOINT: “After all the political events were settled, at least temporarily, the market focus now turns to corporate earnings season. So far, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies have announced positive surprises in their first-quarter earnings,” said Margaret Yang of CMC Markets Singapore.

ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 19 cents to $48.65 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 49 cents, or 1 percent, to $48.84 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 13 cents to $51.39 a barrel. It declined 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $51.52 a barrel in London.

CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 111.99 yen from 111.84 yen. The euro advanced to $1.0921 from $1.0898.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>This lovely piece of work is set in 1962 and inspired by a crucial moment in the life of a real-life Finnish boxer.

“The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki” is a lovely piece of work, a sweet, warmly observed tale overlaid with just the right amount of Scandinavian melancholy, a combination that perfectly suits its quietly engaging protagonist.

Set in 1962 and inspired by a crucial moment in the life of a real-life Finnish boxer, “Olli Mäki” works wonders with a story that only sounds straight-ahead. Coming out of nowhere, this debut feature by Juho Kuosmanen won the Un Certain Regard prize at Cannes last year.

“Olli Mäki” benefits from some gorgeous black-and-white cinematography from director of photography Jani-Petteri Passi. It has a crisp yet evocative look filled with so many memorable images that it makes you wish black-and-white were more alive and well as a visual choice.

Movie Review ‘The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Mäki,’ with Jarkko Lahti, Oona Airola, Eero Milonoff. Directed by Juho Kuosmanen, from a screenplay by Kuosmanen and Mikko Myllylahti. 92 minutes. Not rated; for mature audiences. In Finnish and English with subtitles. Guild 45th. The Los Angeles Times does not provide star ratings with reviews.

The heart of a project like this has to be natural acting from its key players, and “Olli Mäki” is so effective in this regard that you soon forget you are not watching real people going about their lives.

The title character (Jarkko Lahti) is introduced taking a trip to his rural hometown to see Raija Janka (Oona Airola), a young woman he’s recently met. Their growing feeling for each other trumps all, so much so that when Olli goes to Helsinki, Raija goes along with him.

It’s only when he is met by his manager, Elis Ask (Eero Milonoff), that Olli’s situation becomes clear. This modest man, more at ease with children than adults and someone who literally wouldn’t hurt a fly, is just two weeks away from the biggest bout of his career, a title featherweight fight with accomplished American Davey Moore.

Elis understandably wants Olli to focus on his preparations, except that Olli has fallen in love. His attention is split between what he knows he should be doing to succeed at a craft he loves and what his heart tells him to do. This dilemma is not an original one, but the treatment it’s given in “Olli Mäki” makes it seem like it is.

Most effective of all is the way the film is alive to the pleasures and difficulties of life in a way that constantly surprises us.

Speaking of the unexpected, keep your eye out for an old couple who amble through a scene near this film’s end. Yes, it is the real Olli and Raija, walking off the screen and into our hearts.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Exquisite visuals and a delicately shaded performance by Emilia Clarke as a nurse trying to unlock the emotions of a pathologically withdrawn boy living in an isolated castle in Tuscany are the picture’s great strengths. Rating: 3.5 stars out of 4.

An ancient castle, its crenulated tower looking out onto woods shrouded in mist. A crypt, the final resting place of 40 generations of castle inhabitants.

A heavy door, creaking open to reveal the craggy, glowering face of a disapproving old man. A mysterious master of the manse, darkly brooding. A pathologically withdrawn boy, rendered mute by the death of his beloved mother from a wasting illness. A dewy young nurse, arriving at this isolated place, given the task of somehow helping the boy to overcome his trauma and speak once more.

There’s even a ghost.

Movie Review ???½ ‘Voice from the Stone,’ with Emilia Clarke, Edward Dring, Marton Csokas, Lisa Gastoni, Caterina Murino, Remo Girone. Directed by Eric Howell, from a screenplay by Andrew Shaw, based on the novel “La Voce Della Pietra” by Silvio Raffo. 90 minutes. Rated R for some sexuality/nudity. Varsity.

All elements of a classic haunted-house story are present and accounted for in “Voice from the Stone.”

This impressive first feature from director Eric Howell is remarkably assured and elegantly mounted thanks to the cinematography of Peter Simonite and the production design of Davide De Stefano — who make the most of the castle in Tuscany where much of the picture was shot.

Adapted by screenwriter Andrew Shaw from the novel “La Voce Della Pietra” by Italian writer Silvio Raffo, “Voice from the Stone” is a genteel mood piece rather than a full-on fright fest.

Restraint seems to have been Howell’s guiding principle as he creates a mood not of fear, but of growing unease on the part of the young woman (played by Emilia Clarke in a role very different from her “Mother of Dragons” character in “Game of Thrones”).

As the nurse, Verena, she is self-assured, tender but determined to persuade the boy Jakob (9-year-old Edward Dring) that “the dead do not speak” and that he must stop listening at the castle walls in the hope of hearing his mother’s voice murmuring in the stones. As she does so, her relationship with the boy’s formidable father (Marton Csokas) gradually shifts from one of cautious reserve to one of growing passion.

Isolated in the castle and with the encouragement of a white-haired grandmotherly figure (Lisa Gastoni), she delves into the background of the boy’s lovely concert-pianist mother (Caterina Murino). And the deeper she goes the more she begins to believe that she, too, hears the mother’s voice, whispering from beyond the grave.

She implores the spirit, “let me care for him (the boy). Let me care for them both (father and son).” And her own persona begins to change as she starts to take on the characteristics of the dead woman.

With her wonderfully expressive face, Clarke carries the picture, navigating her character’s gradual transformation with grace and conviction. She and the movie’s exquisite visuals make “Voice from the Stone” a classic genre piece.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) — The Grateful Dead performed thousands of concerts, none acclaimed quite like their May 8, 1977, show at a Cornell University field house on a freakishly snowy night.

Revered by Deadheads and honored by the Library of Congress, the Barton Hall show is back in the psychedelic spotlight on its 40th anniversary. On Monday, “Grateful Dead Day” will be rung in, literally, with Dead tunes played on chimes in Cornell’s clock tower. There’s a new book on the show, “Cornell ’77,” by Peter Conners. And a remastered recording titled “Cornell 5/8/77” is being commercially released to complement the bootleg tapes that have stoked the reputation of the show for four decades.

“It was just an exceptional show from the get-go,” said Mark Nathanson, who as a 19-year-old drove to the show from Toledo, Ohio. “You could tell that the environment was right, the band was right, the crowd was right. All the combinations that are required for one of those magical shows were all there.”

The Dead played an estimated 2,300 shows over three decades from their 1965 birth in the San Francisco Bay Area through frontman Jerry Garcia’s death in 1995. Their shows were famous for their length, counter-cultural vibe, improvisational style and wide-ranging musical vocabulary ranging from bluegrass to psychedelic rock.

Identifying the absolute best show over the 30-year span is as useful as trying to name the greatest painting or the strongest superhero. But Barton Hall is a consistent contender on top-ten lists by both critics and fans.

Ithaca’s show was sandwiched between Boston and Buffalo on a swing through the East Coast. At least several thousand fans packed into the old stone building on the Ivy League campus. Aficionados say the band was tight on that tour after months in the studio, but their mood seemed loose that day.

Nathanson recalls Garcia grinning on stage and earlier sticking his head from the band’s Cadillac window to launch good-natured gibes at people waiting to get in.

Students who paid $6.50 for an advance ticket ($7.50 at the door and for non-students) heard a band at its height on a good night. The legend came later.

High-quality bootleg tapes recorded from the soundboard became popular among Deadheads to trade and share. Version of songs including “Morning Dew” and “St. Stephen” built the show’s reputation over the years. Covers that night included Merle Haggard’s “Mama Tried,” an appropriate choice since it was Mother’s Day.

Even some of the people there say they only fully appreciated the performance after listening to the tapes.

“I vaguely remember thinking this was a really good show,” said Robert Cooper, then a 26-year-old Cornell graduate living on a commune nearby. “But to say I went home and said, ‘This is probably one of the greatest shows ever!’ No.”

Even the establishment was impressed, eventually. The Barton Hall show was inducted into the Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry, a rarified collection that showcases America’s recorded heritage. It was part of a 2011 class that also included Prince’s “Purple Rain,” and the Vince Guaraldi Trio’s “A Charlie Brown Christmas.”

More official honors came this year when county officials proclaimed Monday as Grateful Dead Day. The proclamation will be read that evening before “Playin’ in the Band” and some other Dead standards are interpreted on Cornell’s chimes.

Barton Hall’s legend was built on the music. Cultural historian Dennis McNally, who has written about the Dead, said it was a brilliant show in a year many Deadheads consider the band’s finest. But he said the show’s reputation also was burnished by weird weather that day. What started as a fine spring day ended with a plunge in temperature and an unusual May snowfall that required Nathanson to clear several inches from his car.

“The fluorescent lights that were in the parking area really made the snow look like sparkling diamonds,” Nathanson recalled, “and I said … ‘a pristine ending to a pristine show,’ as we got into the car.”</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>LOS ANGELES (AP) — MTV is heralding the start of summer viewing season with its Movie & TV Awards.

Formerly known as the MTV Movie Awards, TV shows are newly eligible for Golden Popcorn trophies at this year’s ceremony, which will broadcast live Sunday from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

MTV is also breaking down gender barriers in its new format, with men and women competing together in the acting categories.

The show is keeping up its traditional irreverence, though, with awards recognizing the best hero, villain, kiss and duo across television and film. Several new categories were added this year: Best American Story, for the program or film that “showcases America at its best”; Best Fight Against the System, which celebrates underdog efforts and social justice; top trending moment; and best musical moment.

The horror hit “Get Out” leads all nominees with six bids, including movie of the year. “Beauty and the Beast” and the Netflix series “Stranger Things” have four nominations each.

The cast of the “Fast and Furious” franchise will receive the Generation Award, which Vin Diesel is set to accept.

Hosted by actor Adam Devine, the MTV Movie & TV Awards will also feature sneak peeks of anticipated films including “Transformers: The Last Knight” and “Spider-Man: Homecoming.”</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>There’s no reason your fun should turn tragic. Just follow some common-sense guidelines from experts.

Experts offer several tips for staying safe on the water this summer:

• Don’t drink alcohol and don’t smoke marijuana while boating.

• Don’t overload boats with more people than a vessel has capacity to accommodate, and ensure there is a life jacket for every person on board.

• Wear a Coast Guard-approved life jacket appropriate for your water activity and ensure children’s life jackets fit well. The state Drowning Prevention Network and Seattle Children’s Hospital is offering coupons for 25 percent off life jackets purchased at Big 5 sporting-goods stores.

• If paddleboarding or kayaking, dress appropriately for cold water and wear brightly colored clothing; wear a personal locating device, like the avalanche beacons carried by backcountry skiers; carry a whistle, a mirror and two forms of communication — for instance, a very high frequency (VHF) radio and a cellphone in a waterproof bag.

• Let friends know your planned route and when you expect to be back. File a float plan with the Coast Guard, which now has an app dedicated to the recreational boating community.

• Write your name and contact information on small paddlecraft; the Coast Guard often finds derelict watercraft but can’t tell if someone is missing or a craft simply broke away from a dock.

• If you find yourself in trouble, get out of the water at any cost.

• If you’re a bystander, try to pull the person to safety or throw something to cling to, even if it’s a cooler or a seat cushion.

• If you’re unable to help someone floundering in the water, be a good witness and provide a starting point for searchers.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — USA Hockey has selected 23 players to the women’s national team for the Olympics, and all but two helped the United States earn the gold medal at the Women’s World Championship last month.

Hilary Knight, who scored the overtime winner over Canada to give the U.S. women their fourth straight title at the world championship, is one of 12 members selected who also played on the silver medal-winning 2014 Olympic team.

The others include: Meghan Duggan, Kacey Bellamy, Megan Bozek, Alex Carpenter, Kendall Coyne, Brianna Decker, Amanda Kessel, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, Monique Lamoureux-Morando, Gigi Marvin and Lee Stecklein.

Forwards Kelli Stack and Haley Skarupa, who played at worlds, were replaced by Dani Cameranesi and Annie Pankowski.

A roster-leading six players are from Minnesota. Former Gophers star Robb Stauber is the head coach.

Players and staff will relocate to the Tampa area in September to train in preparation for the 2018 Olympics in South Korea.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>After success in Australia, she has decided to take a second shot at making the WNBA and is in Seattle’s training camp.

After six years of setbacks and success, Sami Whitcomb knows it’s impossible to predict how this homecoming and her second try to make the WNBA will play out.

For now, it’s enough that she has been invited to the Storm training camp as a free agent — a move that returns her to Seattle, where she was a standout for the Washington Huskies.

“I’ve really enjoyed my path in getting back here,” Whitcomb said in advance of the Storm’s exhibition opener at 11:30 a.m. Wednesday against the Phoenix Mercury at KeyArena.

“This isn’t how I planned for my career, but I wouldn’t do anything different. It’s been really special.”

Whitcomb is a 28-year-old rookie with a deadly jump shot, five years of international basketball experience and a fair amount of confidence that this time she’ll buck the odds and win a WNBA roster spot.

“It was very much come to training camp and show us what you have and we’ll go from there,” Whitcomb said. “That was as much as I could ask for, and I’m thrilled just for that chance.”

Whitcomb doesn’t need to be here. Not really.

In her words, she’s “built a beautiful life” in Australia where she is a star with the Perth Lynx in the Women’s National Basketball League (WNBL).

The Ventura, Calif., native is building a house in Perth with her partner. Later this year, Whitcomb plans to test for citizenship and will try out for the Australian national team Opals.

“Australia is my home now,” she said with a hint of an Aussie accent. “I feel like a bit of a foreigner (in Seattle). But it’s really exciting. I love that I get to be here. So much has changed since I left.”

She has enjoyed watching from afar the Huskies’ rise to national prominence.

“Gosh, it’s been amazing to see it,” said Whitcomb, who played in one NCAA tournament as a freshman in 2007. “I spent about a month or two with (Kevin) McGuff and coach (Mike) Neighbors when they first came in. I knew straight away that they were going to turn things around.”

Whitcomb, a 5-foot-10 guard who wore No. 32 at Washington, starred her final three seasons. Those were lean years under coach Tia Jackson in which the team had a 34-58 record from 2007 to 2010.

As a senior, Whitcomb led the Huskies in points (13.0), rebounds (5.6) and assists (2.5), but went undrafted in 2010.

She gave up on a professional career after being cut by the Chicago Sky in training camp. Whitcomb returned to UW and took a job as a video coordinator on Jackson’s staff.

When Jackson was fired in 2011, Whitcomb resumed her playing career.

She played two seasons (2011-13) for the ChemCats Chemnitz in Germany and spent the 2013-14 season in Slovakia, where she averaged 15.8 points, 5.9 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 2.9 steals.

But Whitcomb became a star in Australia.

Last season, she set a WNBL record with 652 points in 27 games. She averaged 24.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game, while breaking her league record with 105 three-pointers.

“Playing for the WNBL in Australia, that was really a huge opportunity for me,” Whitcomb said. “Some amazing players in that league. There were WNBA players in there as well.

“For me to be able to get to there and have a little bit of success, it helped me with confidence. It forced me to grow and made me mature into a professional on and off the court.”

Whitcomb, who dropped 30 pounds and is down to 145, credits a commitment to fitness and dieting for her development.

But her three-point prowess put the sharpshooter on the Storm’s radar.

“She’s someone who can shoot the three, and we’re a team that shoots the three,” said coach Jenny Boucek, noting the Storm averaged 20.2 three-point attempts last season to rank second in the WNBA. “On paper, you can see the fit. Now we just have to see how it all plays out.”

Seattle returns nine players from a squad that finished seventh at 16-18 last season. Other training-camp free agents include point guard Jennifer O’Neill and center Nikki Greene.

In addition, the Storm traded for center Carolyn Swords and drafted guard Alexis Peterson and center Lanay Montgomery.

Considering Seattle’s 12-player roster will be finalized after Sunday’s exhibition in Phoenix, Whitcomb knows she’ll have just a few chances to make an impression.

“I have to stand out,” she said. “I have to bring something for them. Obviously, they have a lot of fantastic pieces. They have their stars. I think they need those blue-collar players that come off the bench and might only get two minutes, but contributes and does something even if it’s just the intangibles.”

Note

• Guard Sue Bird, who underwent a left-knee scope in April, will not play in Wednesday’s exhibition against Phoenix. The Storm is also missing third-year forward Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, who is playing in France.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Loyd is an intriguing candidate to replace Sue Bird whenever the 15-year veteran and future Hall of Famer decides to retire.

Breanna Stewart and Sue Bird watched from the sideline as Storm star Jewell Loyd took over the final minutes of Thursday’s training-camp practice.

With the ball in her hands, she sprinted and spun around defenders for layups. When the scout team blocked her path to the basket, she pulled up for midrange jumpers or floaters.

And when the defense adjusted and tilted toward the 5-foot-10 sensation, she fearlessly split double-teams with dribble-drives to the rim or flipped passes to teammates for open shots.

It was a glimpse into a possible future for Loyd — an emerging 23-year-old standout and an intriguing candidate to replace Bird whenever the 15-year veteran and future Hall of Famer decides to retire.

“Sue is still here and she’s still dominating and I’m not going to mess with anything that’s working,” Loyd said. “Being the (playmaker) is Sue’s job, and she’s great at it.

“At times in one-on-one situations or late in the shot clock, the ball is probably going to be in my hands and I get to make a play for me and Stewie and Sue is in the corner. But for the most part, that’s Sue’s job.”

For now.

Loyd’s versatility gives the Storm options unlike many WNBA teams in a league where post and wing players comprised the top six scorers last season.

Phoenix’s Diana Taurasi ranked seventh and led all guards at 17.8 points per game while Loyd — eighth overall — was next at 16.5.

In the NBA, point guards such as Stephan Curry, James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Isaiah Thomas rank among the game’s stars because of their scoring prowess.

Meanwhile, the top WNBA point guards fill the role of pass-first playmakers like Bird, who led the league with 5.8 assists while averaging 12.8 points.

Still, converting Loyd to point guard the way the Houston Rockets did this season with Harden, an MVP front-runner, remains a possibility.

“Jewell has that ability to score and set up her teammates,” Bird said. “She’s still evolving in all of that. As you get older, you find out … that basketball is a game of when to, and not a game of how to. Jewell knows how to do all of it. It’s about her figuring out when to. When to attack. When to set your teammates up.

“James Harden is obviously an exceptional player and that system is all about the threes they shoot and spreading teams out. That’s kind of what we have. To have all of those threats and then attack.”

Coach Jenny Boucek said Loyd, who averaged 3.4 assists and 3.4 rebounds last season, could be a triple-double threat in 2017.

“As a team we want to take what the defense gives us, and Jewell has the talent to make them pay in a lot of different ways,” Boucek said. “We want her to have the ability to read the game and make them be always wrong.”

Loyd, who captured the Rookie of the Year award in 2015, had a breakout season last year in which she was voted to second-team All-WNBA. She improved her scoring, assists, steals and minutes while making a big jump from 20.8 percent to 30.3 in three-point field-goal accuracy.

“I want to be unguardable, and to do that, you have to be able to knock down shots,” Loyd said. “This offseason, I’ve been working on extended range and being comfortable shooting off-balance shots from three.

“I won’t be surprised if you see that go up another 10 percent. I’m confident shooting the ball, and the way we move the ball and get people open, it allows everyone to be a good shooter.”

During the fall and winter, Loyd played for the Shanxi Flame of the Women’s Chinese Basketball Association, where she averaged 34.6 points. An ankle injury cut her WCBA season short and she returned home to Chicago on Christmas Day. Loyd spent the past three months training in preparation for her third WNBA season.

“I’m still learning different stuff,” she said. “But I’m definitely more focused in the sense of competing on every possession and not just going through the motions.

“I’m trying to win every battle and every matchup that I can. … I’m in full attack mode all the time.”

<td class='normal' valign='top'>http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/young-bucks-hope-theyve-learned-lessons-in-time-for-game-6/?utm_source=RSS&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=RSS_all</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>ST. FRANCIS, Wis. (AP) — Sometimes, a young team needs to learn from failure to get better.

Milwaukee Bucks coach Jason Kidd hopes his players build on the lessons learned from a stinker of a Game 5 in their opening-round playoff series against the Toronto Raptors. They need to regroup quickly to avoid elimination when the Raptors and Bucks meet Thursday night at the Bradley Center.

The Bucks got a day off from practice after the 118-93 loss in Toronto that gave the Raptors a 3-2 series lead. They returned to practice Wednesday after a brief break from what has been an increasingly rugged series.

After getting blown out in Game 3 by the Bucks, the Raptors won the next two games in part by being more physical and slowing down Milwaukee.

“Yeah, I hope so,” Kidd said when asked about whether his players learned from the blowout loss. “Today, I thought guys were focused, understanding what we have to do. It’s not hard, but for us the process of being able to be consistent is the one thing that we struggle with.”

Workaholic forward Giannis Antetokounmpo might have been the only player who didn’t want a breather.

“I don’t know, for me, I didn’t need an off-day. But for sure some guys played a lot of minutes, their bodies are sore,” Antetokounmpo said. “I think for some guys it’s good to get some rest so we can bring more energy tomorrow.”

For all of his athleticism, the 22-year-old Antetokounmpo lacks playoff experience when compared to the postseason-tested Raptors.

Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton are playing in their second career playoff series after the Bucks lost in six games to top-seeded Chicago in 2015. Antetokounmpo’s role has changed now that he’s the focal point of the offense, so he faces more defensive scrutiny.

The team surrounding Antetokounmpo and Middleton has been almost completely made over since then, with injured forward Jabari Parker and center John Henson the only other holdovers. Henson has only played three minutes against Toronto.

Two other starters, guard Malcolm Brogdon and center Thon Maker, are rookies. Even center Greg Monroe, a seven-year veteran who provides scoring punch off the bench, is making his playoff debut. Fourth-year players Tony Snell (Bulls) and Matthew Dellavedova (Cavaliers) joined the Bucks this season, brought to Milwaukee in part because of their postseason experience.

In contrast, the Raptors have been through about every conceivable playoff situation after losing to Cleveland in the Eastern Conference finals last season. Led by one of the best backcourts in the game in DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, Toronto is no stranger to adversity.

“You definitely see that experience come into play and we just understand the moment probably a little bit more than them. That’s not to take away (anything) from them,” DeRozan said. “They are a great team, a young team and this is definitely going to be an experience they will learn from and carry over but for now it’s something we have to keep in mind and understand the moment of going into every single game … to try and close this thing out.”

Milwaukee’s transition game is off track with 31 turnovers over the last two contests.

“That’s the physicality part, because it’s the playoffs, because it’s more intense. You get away with slaps, holds, grabs and that’s a trick of the trade,” said Jason Terry, a 17-year veteran who is averaging about 10 minutes a game off the bench for the Bucks this series.

“If you haven’t (been) through that, you don’t know it until you face it,” Terry said. “I think for us being a young team, now that we’ve seen it four or five games consecutively, hopefully now we can adjust.”

NOTES: Middleton missed practice with an illness that has been bothering the Bucks’ second-leading scorer (14.7 points) all week. Middleton was 3 of 8 for eight points in 35 minutes in Game 5. Kidd said he didn’t think the illness was a factor, and that Middleton had good looks and played well defensively. He expected Middleton to start on Thursday. … Kidd said he wasn’t pondering any lineup changes for Game 6.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>I met Adnan and Amena this week in Greece, working in one of the camps about an hour outside of Athens. Adnan thanked our group for coming and for letting him help us. He told one of the volunteers in our group that his life for the last 14 months has consisted of waking up, eating, and going back to sleep and it was making him sick and depressed. No purpose for me, he said. Then, Thank you. You give me work. Thank you.

I know some of the benefits of gratitude, based on personal observation and scientific research: improved resilience, improved self-esteem, enhanced empathy, reduced aggression and increased happiness, to name a few. What I have been reminded of this week is how amazing it is to see gratitude expressed for things that have never occurred to me.

In one of the camps we visited, the refugees aren't allowed to cook – they are given rations three times a day, like it or leave it. They miss being able to cook for their families. Gratitude for the ability to work, for fresh fruit, for a place to play and a place to pray – the refugees we have worked with this week are grateful for all those things and more.

Thursday, we saw how much gratitude parents can have when you can get their child to smile. On that day, our group worked alongside missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to hold a Build-A-Buddy event. From tiny babies to teens, 200 children got to build a stuffed animal of their choosing and then dress their animal as well. Everything from turtles to elephants to bunnies and bears got dressed in princess clothes, explorer outfits and as baseball players – and many other unique and interesting combinations. The grins on those kids faces lit up the tent we were in like floodlights and their grins made their parents smile too.

The Build-A-Buddy project was followed by a magic show put on by Utah magician and motivational speaker Mike Hamilton. The tent was filled with hundreds of camp residents, from the very young to the very seasoned, and Mike quickly had them enthralled, cheering, whistling, clapping and laughing at the latest trick. For a brief moment, the outside world faded away and they could be caught up in something that made them smile.

After the show, a number of the adults wanted to express their gratitude and appreciation that we would take the time to come to Greece, then come to their camp and be with them for a day. They hugged us, cried with us, shared with us some of their stories and they thanked us, over and over and over, for bringing a bit of light and hope into their world. Desmond Tutu, who saw some very dark times in South Africa, said, Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness. Sometimes hope comes in the form of a good day's work. Sometimes it comes in the form of a stuffed animal and a magic show.

The young stars of the year’s funniest global home video have been transformed into a cartoon by a Brooklyn couple hoping that the precocious kids will be just as cute in two dimensions.

The two children, Marion and James Kelly, who became a brief obsession for the internet-using world when they adorably interrupted their father’s BBC interview in March, are the inspiration for a new cartoon featuring their likenesses, as well as those of their parents, Robert E. Kelly and Kim Jeong-ah.

The show, “The Adventures of Mina & Jack,” consists of only one short episode at the moment, though another is in the works. The characters’ names have been changed, but their images are unmistakable, and the episode features a brief tribute to the viral moment that brought it into being. So far, it can only be seen on YouTube, and no major (or minor) outlet has signed up to distribute it.

Marion became a favorite of viewers the world over when she strolled into the room where her father, fated to be known forever after as the “BBC Dad,” was conducting an interview about South Korean politics. She was closely trailed by her infant brother, who was in a walker. Mr. Kelly chose to continue the interview; at the end of the clip, his wife dashes in, sliding across the floor and almost falling in her effort to remove the kids from the room.

Lauren Martin, who used to write for Elite Daily and is now a producer who helps create content at Complex, pronounced herself “obsessed” with the clip in an interview on Thursday, saying that she thought she had watched the video “like 100 times.”

“I just love Marion,” Ms. Martin, 26, said. “I just love her.”

She and her boyfriend, Jarryd Mandy, who live in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, decided that the world needed more of the Kelly kids. Originally they had planned to write a children’s book, but decided the project would be better as a cartoon. The couple contracted a studio, Raxo, to make a pilot episode. Here it is.

The Williamsburg couple decided not to seek the family’s blessing before they had a finished product, and sent the first cartoon to Mr. Kelly with bated breath.</td>

A RABBLE OF DEAD MONEY: The Great Crash and the Global Depression, 1929-1939, by Charles R. Morris. (PublicAffairs, $29.99.) This overview of the policy response to the Great Depression is a deft synthesis, blending colorful accounts of the past with the scholarly literature of the present and stretching beyond U.S. borders. Instead of focusing on Wall Street, Morris turns his attention to the other side of the Atlantic, arguing that “All of the tangled threads that twisted together to create the catastrophe of the Depression originated in Europe.”

THE KNOWLEDGE ILLUSION: Why We Never Think Alone, by Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach. (Riverhead, $28.) Two cognitive scientists argue that not only rationality but the very idea of individual thinking is a myth, and that humans think in groups. That’s not necessarily bad news, writes Yuval Harari in our review: “Our reliance on groupthink has made us masters of the world.… From an evolutionary perspective, trusting in the knowledge of others has worked extremely well for humans.”

MY CAT YUGOSLAVIA, by Pajtim Statovci. Translated by David Hackston. (Pantheon, $25.95.)

<td class='normal' valign='top'>FCA The Dodge Challenger SRT Demon is built to be an elite performance machine.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recently unveiled its 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon during the New York International Auto Show, declaring it “unlike anything before.” The Demon is gaining a great deal of buzz, and for good reason. The impressive speed machine boasts specs setting it apart from other vehicles in its category and pays homage to drag racing.

For the team at Chapman Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram, the arrival of the Demon can’t come soon enough.

The muscle of the Demon is unmatched with that of the most powerful Ferrari. With 840 horsepower, 40 more than the Ferrari, the Demon boasts a quarter-mile in 9.65 seconds and reaches 60 mph in 2.3 seconds. A whopping 770 pound-feet of torque, combined with a 6.2 liter Hemi Demon V-8 engine, ensures it’s the fastest and most powerful production car Dodge has ever produced.

As if Dodge didn’t separate itself enough from the competition, the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon is also the first-ever production car to have wheelie capabilities. Guinness World Records verified the 2.9- feet front-wheel lift sets a world record for production cars.

“Dodge continues to lead the pack in innovation, and the 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon is a prime example of that,” said Don Hamrick, general manager of Chapman Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram. “A vehicle shattering records in its category, we’re excited to bring it to our dealerships here in Vegas.”

Each purchase of a 2018 Dodge Demon comes with a full-day session at the Bob Bondurant School of High-Performance Driving, located in Phoenix, Arizona. More details, including price, will be revealed once production for the cars begins later this year.

Chapman Automotive, with four locations in Southern Nevada, is celebrating five decades of providing exemplary customer service, dedication to the community, along with an extensive selection of new and used vehicles.

All dealerships are open for sales from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Parts and service are open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday.</td>

Thelma Migliore

As a baby, Matthew Migliore had to wear casts to straighten his deformed toes and ankles. Doctors predicted he would never walk; instead, the 33-year-old northwest valley man is set to run in the Special Olympics’ Law Enforcement Torch Run.

Employees from the North Las Vegas Police Department and more than 40 other agencies were set to run alongside six or seven Special Olympics Nevada athletes beginning May 5, passing through Henderson, Las Vegas and North Las Vegas on May 12. They are set to carry the “Flame of Hope” from Boulder City to Reno, where the Summer Games begin June 9.

The Torch Run, which began in 1981 in Wichita, Kansas, is the Special Olympics’ largest grassroots fundraiser and public-awareness event, raising $56 million worldwide each year, Las Vegas-based executive committee member Robert Woolsey said. The run started in Nevada in 1989.

Migliore was born with Pierre Robin syndrome, a rare craniofacial deformity that causes mild bone and blood diseases; he’s set to run from Hoover Dam to Nellis Air Force Base on May 12. He said he has been participating in the Torch Run for 14 years. In 2014, he was chosen to represent Nevada in the LETR Final Leg in the Special Olympics USA Games in New Jersey. Migliore said he also has won more than 60 gold medals as part of the Special Olympics Nevada soccer, bowling and golf teams.

His mother, Thelma, said he didn’t begin walking until he was nearly 6, but ever since, she hasn’t been able to keep up with him.

Migliore will run all but one leg of the race between Henderson and U.S. 95, she added.

“He will run the whole thing if they let him,” his mother said. “His brain doesn’t know it, but his body is getting older and it needs to slow down.”

Woolsey has participated in the Torch Run since 1999 and got heavily involved with planning in 2004. After colleague Carl Cox with the Elko County’s Sheriff’s Office, who worked with him on the Torch Run, died from cancer in 2011, Woolsey redesigned the run to reflect Cox’s vision of making it statewide.

Woolsey has a cousin who has severe autism.

“We live in the kind of world where people shy away from people who are different,” he said. “The good thing about the Special Olympics is that it combines people with disabilities (and those who don’t) with sports, which is kind of that thing that builds a bridge between the two … It gives those athletes a opportunity to build and achieve the same things as the rest of us.

I don’t think there’s anything else in the world that you could do for people who are more deserving or more grateful.”

This is North Las Vegas Police Officer Laurianne Lee’s first Torch Run. It’s also the first time since 2004 that the department has had a leg in the event, she said. Lee gathered a team including a firefighter, junior officers, city employees, her son and a running group to run about 2 miles from North Las Vegas Municipal Court to the College of Southern Nevada’s North Las Vegas Campus. She said she has a personal goal of raising $1,000 and hopes the group can get up to $10,000.

Lee said she’s running for her younger brother Nikolai, who was born with a brain tumor, and the Special Olympics Nevada athletes.

“When you interact with an athlete, their smiles are completely contagious,” she said. “You can’t leave there without feeling good about yourself. … Without us (Special Olympics) couldn’t operate, and without them we couldn’t feel the awesome things they do.”

Although Thelma won’t be in the race this year, she said she is excited to see her son and the other athletes run.

“It’s one of the most wonderful things to see,” she said. “Some of these kids shouldn’t be walking, and you look at that. You just stare in amazement. You can’t help but shed a tear.”

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Over the past five years, the Smith Center has provided many special memories. Having lived in New York, I loved the Broadway theater so I became a subscriber from the very beginning. I have been there for every show, some better than others but all enjoyable.

The center hit a home run when it brought in “An American In Paris.” The performances by the cast, with special kudos to Garen Scriener and Sara Esty in the leads, gave us a very special evening enjoyed by everyone. The director gave us a magical evening filled with dance, music by Gershwin, and sets to bring us into the mood of the night.

So many letters to the Review-Journal seem to be angry about one thing or another. People should know that there is a special place that brings joy and happiness to those who attend. They see a bit of culture the likes of which cannot be copied within the confines of a casino. Members of the audience come dressed like they are going to a special party.

I say many thanks to those responsible for bringing the Smith Center to Las Vegas.</td>

I would like to wish Desiree Reed-Francois well in her new position as UNLV athletic director.

As a graduate and a not very talented former UNLV athlete, I root for every team and bleed Rebel red whenever we lose. I think we need to take a moment to thank Tina Kunzer-Murphy for her service to the university. I think she did a great job under very tough conditions. What I know is that she loves UNLV as much as any of us and every decision she ever made about UNLV was made because she believed it to be in the best interest of the university.

I wish her well in any future endeavor and thank her for her hard work.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Nevada Gov. Brain Sandoval. (Benjamin Hager/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @benjaminhphoto

I love Nevada. It’s my adopted state for more than 15 years now. I spent the first 40 years of my life living in New York and California. Those are the high-tax places that people are running away from in droves.

Now add in Chicago. There aren’t enough moving vans to satisfy the demand for all the people running away from high-tax Illinois. In the past year, 114,000 citizens escaped from Illinois. The state is losing one resident every 4.6 minutes. That’s the fastest rate ever.

Since 2000, Illinois has lost the population of Joliet, Springfield, Peoria, Naperville, Elgin, Champaign, Arlington Heights, Rockford, Aurora and Waukegan combined.

There is no mistaking why this happened — and it’s not because of cold weather. This all happened at the same time and in response to a massive state income tax and sales and property tax increases. According to IRS data, that loss of population comes with a loss of $30,000 of taxable income every 4.6 minutes.

The state of Illinois is literally shrinking, starving and dying right in front of our eyes.

But Illinois is not alone. Pennsylvania is shrinking, too. And New York and California are losing even more total citizens each year than either Illinois or Pennsylvania.

This is where Nevada comes in. The people leaving those states are perfect for us — high income citizens, business owners and retirees. These are the exact kind of people we should be recruiting to Nevada.

These are people who don’t need a thing. They are people like me. I came to Nevada in 2002. I’ve paid many hundreds of thousands in sales taxes, property taxes, payroll taxes and fees for my many small businesses.

But I’ve taken nothing out of the state budget. As in nada, zero, zip. I don’t cost taxpayers a cent. I don’t collect welfare, food stamps, free health care, or even education (my kids are homeschooled).

I do nothing but contribute and pay in. I take nothing out.

Why don’t we recruit an army of taxpayers like that?

Here’s Nevada’s chance to double our state’s population with nothing but productive citizens. People who contribute, take nothing out, spend tons of money as consumers and start businesses that create jobs.

We can fill up our entire state with these kind of folks.

All we have to do is set aside a nice-sized chunk of change out of Nevada’s budget to advertise and promote our state to the residents of high-tax states. We need to aggressively advertise in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois and California.

We need ads starring a business owner who can say, “I spent my life in high tax states like New York and California, until I got smart and moved to Las Vegas. It was the best move of my life. In Nevada, my state income taxes, business income taxes, capital gains taxes and inheritance taxes are all zero. And my property taxes are among the lowest in America. I get to keep more of my own money to live a much higher quality of life. Throw in sunshine, warm weather, the best restaurants and entertainment in the world, light traffic compared to any other major city and legal sports betting — and this my friends is heaven. What are you waiting for? Every day you wait is costing you money, a better quality of life and a better life for your family.

“If you’re a business owner, high-income earner or a retiree, you owe it to yourself to explore a move to Nevada.”

Run that ad day and night in every high-tax state and Nevada gains all the best, brightest and richest business owners and retirees in America. We become the small-business capital and retiree capital of the country.

And we become one of the richest states in America. That’s how we make Nevada great.

<td class='normal' valign='top'>https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-to-drain-a-swamp-literally-and-figuratively/2017/05/04/a355c702-2480-11e7-b503-9d616bd5a305_story.html</td>
<td class='normal' valign='top'>There’s been a lot of discussion recently about draining the swamp in Washington, and I’d like to provide some insight into this very important and relevant topic.

It’s very difficult to literally drain a swamp and nearly impossible to drain a figurative one. I should know. If there were such a thing, I could be in charge of coordinating swamp-draining activities for literal swamps and figurative swamps.

I’d be remiss if I didn’t unequivocally state upfront that the District was never built on a literal swamp. It wasn’t built on a figurative swamp, either. This is a myth that has been passed down from generation to generation and deserves clarification. Also, the draining of literal and figurative swamps is an outdated activity.

That said, here are factors to consider when undertaking swamp-draining activities.

Factor No. 1 — Infectious Diseases

Literal Considerations: Literal swamps must not be drained during the rainy and/or warm seasons. Acquiring infectious diseases from mosquitoes and getting a tick-borne illness are real concerns. Stagnant water and humidity in a literal swamp can lead to a host of health issues. No one really wants to get malaria, yellow fever or cryptosporidium. If you have to drain a swamp, it’s best to wait until winter.

Figurative Considerations: Not applicable. Infectious diseases are not present in imaginary swamps.

Factor No. 2 — Displacement of Residents

Literal Considerations: Displacement of individuals residing in or near literal swamps must be considered. I would personally never choose to live in a swamp, but there are those who do. Swamp people don’t like having their land taken. My advice is to find them a new swamp that doesn’t need to be drained and ask them to move there.

Figurative Considerations: Not applicable. No one lives in imaginary swamps.

Factor No. 3 — Swamp Goo

Literal Considerations: A practical matter to consider when attempting to drain a literal swamp is where to put the gooey stuff. Non-swamp towns don’t like taking in swamp-related goo. The best suggestion is to see if Canada is willing to trade something for our goo. Maybe we could offer to take Drake off of their hands in return for swamp materials. It would be an even trade.

Figurative Considerations: Not applicable. There’s no goo in imaginary swamps.

Factor No. 4 — Swamp Thing

Literal Considerations: Not applicable. Swamp Thing is make-believe.

Figurative Considerations: Totally Applicable. Caution must be maintained always if evidence of the creature’s existence is recognized in said swamp to be drained. Evidence includes horror-movie music, monster dung and weird bubbles emanating from the middle of the swamp.

This is not a comprehensive guide, but it’s a good starting point when endeavoring to drain swamps.

As stated above, literal swamp-draining, while challenging, is a completely doable activity.

Figurative swamp-draining, on the other hand, is a very arduous task. It’s hard enough to even locate the figurative swamp to be drained. In my years of experience on the job, most figurative swamps aren’t figurative swamps at all. In many cases, they are just a silly slogan.</td>

<td class='normal' valign='top'>Attempting comprehensive tax reform is like trying to tug many bones from the clamped jaws of many mastiffs. Every provision of the code — now approaching 4 million words — was put there to placate a clamorous faction, or to create a grateful group that will fund its congressional defenders. Still, Washington will take another stab at comprehensiveness, undeterred by the misadventures of comprehensive immigration and health-care reforms. Consider just one tax change that should be made and certainly will not be.

The deductibility of mortgage interest payments, by which the government will forgo collecting nearly $1 trillion in the next decade, is treated as a categorical imperative graven on the heart of humanity by the finger of God because it is a pleasure enjoyed primarily by the wealthy. About 75 percent of American earners pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes, and only around 30 percent of taxpayers itemize their deductions. Ike Brannon, of the Cato Institute and Capital Policy Analytics in Washington, argues that, given America’s homeownership rate of about 63 percent, not even half of all homeowners use the deduction. Its principal beneficiaries are affluent (also attentive and argumentative) homeowners, and its benefits, as Brannon says, “scale up” regressively: The larger the mortgage and the higher the tax bracket, the more valuable the deduction is.

Perhaps the deduction’s net effect is a higher rate of homeownership, which can benefit society by encouraging respect for property rights, the thrift necessary for a substantial investment and a sense of having a stake in the community. But the unpleasantness of 2008 demonstrated the downside of encouraging too much homeownership. Furthermore, the deduction might actually suppress homeownership by being priced into rising housing costs. Besides, Australia, Canada and Britain, which have no mortgage interest deductions, have homeownership rates comparable to that of the United States.

Homeownership is, Brannon argues, a way for people to hold their wealth; it is not an investment because “it does not improve the productive capacity of the economy.” Indeed, the more money that flows into housing, the less flows into stocks, bonds or banks.

Government policy is like a Calder mobile — touch something here and things jiggle over there. For example, the president has acted to discourage the use of Canadian wood when making planks for the rising edifice of American greatness. A 20 percent tariff on softwood imports from Canada — about 30 percent of the softwood lumber used in U.S. residential housing construction — is retaliation for Canada’s government supposedly charging Canadian lumber interests too little for trees harvested in government forests. The tariff will raise the price of flooring and siding and therefore of houses.

Dismayed U.S. homebuilders foresee a 6.4 percent increase; U.S. lumber interests say that is an exaggeration. Even allowing for theatricality on both sides, lumber protectionism will certainly deepen two problems: Because the mortgage interest deduction enables higher housing prices, Americans will continue to pour too much wealth into housing. And inequality will be exacerbated. Homeownership is crucial to the accumulation of wealth. But as social scientist Joel Kotkin writes, millennials are caught in a pincer of low incomes — the Census Bureau estimates that even those with a full-time job earn $2,000 less in real dollars than the same age cohort did in 1980 — and high housing prices. Kotkin says “homeownership rates for people under 35 have dropped 21 percent” since 2004.

And there is this: The percentage of persons ages 25 to 34 who have never been married has risen from 12 in 1960 to 47 today. There are cultural as well as economic reasons for this delay in two powerful economic multipliers — family formation and house-buying — but certainly, the rising cost of housing is a factor. This is just one of the unseen costs of protectionism’s seen benefit of a small number of domestic jobs protected.

Elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would have to be grandfathered to accommodate those who budgeted for their home purchases with the deduction in mind. Even so, it will not happen. Neither will limiting the deduction by denying it to a tiny top sliver of the largest mortgages — say, portions of mortgages over $500,000. People are loss-averse — they resist surrendering any benefit, even if they would reap bigger benefits from increased economic growth that would result from a more sensible allocation of society’s resources. And the political class is risk-averse, unwilling to challenge the affluent, or 1 million organized Realtors. The sound you hear is of mastiffs growling.
