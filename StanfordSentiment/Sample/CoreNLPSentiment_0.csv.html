Wednesday at the Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, FBI Director James Comey said Wikileaks was not journalism, but “intelligence porn.”

Comey said, “In that there is at least a portion, and people can argue that maybe this conduct Wikileaks is engaged on in the past that is closer to regular news gathering, but in my view, a huge portion of Wikileaks’ activities has nothing to do with legitimate news gathering, informing the public, commenting on important controversies but releasing classified information to damage the United States of America. People start to get cynical about journalists, but American journalists do not do that.”

“They almost always call us before classifying publishing information to say, is there anything that will jeopardize government people, or innocent civilians anywhere in the world and work with us to try to accomplish their important First Amendment goals by safeguarding the interests. This activity, I’m talking about Wikileaks, involves so much considerations whatsoever,” he continued. “It is intelligence porn, push it out in order to damage.”

Pop singer Katy Perry is once against facing fierce backlash online after jokingly comparing her “old black hair” to former President Barack Obama.

“Oh, someone says, ‘I miss your old black hair,'” the “Firework” singer said in an Instagram video over the weekend. “Oh, really? Do you miss Barack Obama as well? Oh, Okay. Times change. Bye! See you guys later.”

Perry has since deleted the Instagram video.

The joke, however, did not go over well, with many social media users taking offense to Perry likening her old hairstyle to the first black U.S. president.

Katy Perry joke was just very tasteless. What does black hair have to do with Barack Obama……………..just bad. — Nia (@faggerella) April 30, 2017

One Twitter user pointed out that President Obama has more Grammy Awards than Perry, who has been nominated 13 times.

Sometimes when I think that the world is an awful place, I remember that Barack Obama has more Grammys than Katy Perry, and I feel better. — Steph (@stphfrndz) April 30, 2017

Perry supported Obama’s reelection in 2012.

To be sure, not everyone was offended by her joke.

@PerezHilton @katyperry y'all twisted this up. she wants Obama back but can't have him back…the same way people want her old hair & won't get it back b/c its gone — Jessica (@Jes00sica) May 1, 2017

Katy Perry meant she wants Obama back and can't have him same way ppl want her black hair and won't get it back … Christ ppl lol — Wally Szczerbiak (@findingwhitney) April 30, 2017

Perry has increasingly found herself on the receiving end of online fury for what appear to be innocuous social media posts.

Last month, the 32-year-old star came under fire after posting an image of a Hindu goddess on her Instagram page, captioning the photo “current mood.”

Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” reporter Carl Bernstein said President Donald Trump had “lied as no president of the United States in my lifetime.”

Bernstein said “I wish this president well. He is the duly elected president of the United States, and he deserves respect as the duly elected president of the United States. That doesn’t mean he deserves not to be called on lies. He has lied as no president of the United States in my lifetime has, day in and day out. It is our job to look, as I said in that address to the correspondents’ dinner last night: follow the money, yes, but follow the lies as well.”

Despite continuous stories in the media reporting that President Donald Trump has the lowest favorable rating in his first 100 days of any president in modern history, Congress’s approval is worse.

A new Gallup poll shows Trump’s favorable rating stands at 40 percent, one percentage point above 39 percent for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI).

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s favorable rating is eight percentage points lower than Ryan’s at 31 percent.

But the honor for having the lowest rating goes to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), which stands at 27 percent.

“As the possibility of a government shutdown looms, fewer than one in three Americans view either party’s U.S. Senate leader favorably,” Gallup reported on Wednesday. “Although both men have been prominent figures in Congress for decades, roughly a third of Americans don’t know either well enough to have an opinion.”

The Gallup data, collected in an April 5-9 poll, marks the first time Gallup has measured Schumer’s popularity and notes that his 31 percent matches the same number for McConnell when he was first rated in 2010.

“McConnell’s image has been consistently less positive than that in polls since then, with his favorable rating ranging mostly in the 20s — and his 18% favorable in 2015 marking a low for the majority leader. Since 2013, Americans have consistently been more likely to have an unfavorable view of McConnell,” Gallup reported.

Gallup reports that Ryan’s’s popularity has declined by almost 10 percentage points since the failure of the American Health Care Act — from 48 percent in November 2016 to 39 percent in April.

“Ryan is not alone in low ratings among House leadership,” Gallup reported. “Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, currently has a 34% favorable rating and a 48% unfavorable rating — slightly worse than Ryan’s.”

This week Ryan’s popularity will face new challenges as the House weighs in on Trump’s tax reform proposal and funding the government.

“A key to Ryan’s survival as speaker will be in maintaining GOP support in Congress, something that Boehner was unable to do,” Gallup reported.</td>

The Wall Street Journal in an editorial over the weekend said Democrats are trying to squelch the story of Susan Rice’s unmasking of Trump campaign officials, and the House and Intelligence committees should investigate the former national security adviser.

“The House and Senate Intelligence committees should investigate what she did and why,” the Wall Street Journal argued in an April 28 piece.

Last month, blogger Mike Cernovich and other news outlets reported that Rice had unmasked, or identified the names, of Trump campaign officials caught up during surveillance of a foreign target.

The piece said Democrats raised a fuss in 2005 over then-senior Bush official John Bolton doing the same thing but with far more justification, due to the job he held, but are now “going all in to squelch” the story.

“Then Senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd kicked up a fuss that, as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Mr. Bolton had 10 times over four years asked for the names of American officials who were swept up in National Security Agency monitoring.”

“Democrats and their press allies are going all in to squelch the Susan Rice ‘unmasking’ story, insisting that the decision by Barack Obama’s national security adviser to seek the name of at least one Trump campaign official was routine and no big deal,” it said.

For example, it said, “House Intelligence Committee Democrat Adam Schiff released a tutorial on why unmasking is ‘lawful.’ ‘Susan Rice Did Nothing Wrong,’ said an NBC headline, quoting no one on the record.”

The Wall Street Journal editorial also pointed out that while Rice and Democrats have defended her actions as “not uncommon,” Democrats and the media in 2005 characterized it as unusual.

At that time, Dodd claimed unmasking was “rarely requested” and “infrequently” by “political appointees such as Mr. Bolton.” The New York Times also reported that requests to unmask “are not common, particularly from policy makers.”

The editorial also argued that there was no apparent reason for Rice to have requested the unmasking of Trump campaign officials’ names, contrary to her explanations.

“Ms. Rice had no direct intelligence duties in her NSC post, and no Democrat has provided a valid reason that Ms. Rice might have needed to unmask anyone associated with the Trump presidential campaign,” the editorial said.

Rice has denied doing anything “untoward” with the intelligence she received, as did Bolton. But Democrats had drawn up a list of 36 individuals that he clashed with and called on National Intelligence Director John Negroponte to rule out they were the target of Bolton’s unmasking.

And while House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has stepped aside from his committee’s Russia probe after complaints from left-wing activist groups that he discussed unmasking in public, Democrats in 2005 “couldn’t stop talking to the press,” the piece said.

The piece also pointed out that names unmasked by Bolton have still never made it out to the public, in contrast with the illegal leaking in February of phone conversations held by former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

“Twelve years on, not one of the 10 individuals unmasked by Mr. Bolton has had his or her identity leaked. By contrast, the Washington Post reports that no fewer than nine Obama appointees or career officials leaked or confirmed the identity and conversations of unmasked former Trump adviser Michael Flynn.

“If John Bolton’s unmasking was questionable, then Mrs. Rice’s was more so. The House and Senate Intelligence committees should investigate what she did and why.”

Rice is expected to be among witnesses asked by the House intelligence committee to testify in its ongoing probe of Russian interference in the elections.</td>

“A prominent Florida eye doctor has been convicted on all counts in his Medicare fraud trial, raising the possibility he could be pressured to testify in the bribery trial of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez,” the Associated Press reported on Friday afternoon:

Jurors announced their verdict Friday for Dr. Salomon Melgen. He effectively faces a life sentence if no deal is struck. Menendez denies any wrongdoing. Prosecutors contended that the 62-year-old Melgen stole up to $105 million from the federal insurance program between 2008 and 2013, by giving patients treatments and tests that couldn’t help them. Melgen’s attorneys argued that any billing issues were simply mistakes.

As Breitbart News has reported, the testimony presented by the prosecution’s expert medical witnesses during the trial was very damaging, while the testimony of his own defense witnesses backfired.

The jury announced the verdict after its third day of deliberation.

On April 1, 2015, Melgen and his friend and political contribution beneficiary, Sen. Robert Menendez (D-New Jersey), were indicted on charges of public corruption.

Two weeks later, on April 15, Melgen was indicted on 76 charges of Medicare fraud. “[P]rosecutors said [Melgen] attempted to bilk the health care program out of as much as $190 million,” the Associated Press reported at the time of the second indictment.

Sen. Menendez has previously indicated he intends to run for re-election in 2018.

With Melgen now facing life in prison, he will have reasons to consider cooperating with prosecutors as they present their case against Menendez.

Steven Sandberg, a spokesman for the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey, referred an NJ Advance Media reporters’ inquiry to a statement released earlier in the day by Menendez’s attorney, Abbe David Lowell. “I have spoken to Sen. Menendez and he is saddened for his long-time friend and is thinking of his family on this difficult day,” wrote Lowell. “As we have known for the past two years, the issues involved in Dr. Melgen’s case in south Florida had no bearing on the allegations made against the senator, and this verdict will have no impact on him. “Dr. Melgen’s case focused solely on the day-to-day operations of his medical practice and the private care of his patients – specifics of which the Senator could not be aware, nor has it ever been suggested otherwise. “From the beginning, Senator Menendez has been clear that he has always acted in accordance with the law and in his appropriate legislative oversight role as a member of Congress. When all of the facts are heard, he is fully confident that a jury will agree and he will be vindicated.”

That trial is set to begin in a New Jersey federal courtroom in the fall.</td>

WASHINGTON D.C. — Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan is growing stronger with the resurgence of the Taliban in recent years and “remains a direct threat” to America more than a decade and a half after the United States began targeting both terrorist groups in response to 9/11, an expert tells House lawmakers.

In October 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan, and the war against the Taliban and al-Qaeda has been raging since.

President Donald Trump inherited chaos and overall deteriorating security conditions in the war-devastated country.

Under former President Barack Obama’s watch, the Taliban seized more territory in Afghanistan than during any time since the U.S. military removed the jihadist group from power in 2001 and the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) gained a foothold in the country.

The U.S. military “downplayed this problem of the Taliban” during Obama’s tenure, Bill Roggio, an expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and editor of the Long War Journal, told the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism.

“If that’s the attitude of the U.S. military towards the Taliban inside Afghanistan, we will continue to lose this war,” he later added. “We need to reassess Afghanistan… our policy in Afghanistan is a mess frankly, and the Trump administration needs to decide what to do and how to do it quickly.”

“The Taliban—al-Qaeda relationship remains strong to this day. And with the Taliban gaining control of a significant percentage of Afghanistan’s territory, al-Qaeda has more areas to plant its flag,” also said Roggio in his written testimony.

Last Friday, the Taliban carried out its deadliest-ever attack on a major military base in northern Balkh province that left as many as 250 soldiers dead.

Although the U.S. military argues the Afghan conflict is at a “stalemate,” Roggio told the House panel that America is losing the war.

“We are losing in Afghanistan… and The Taliban controls or contests at least half of Afghanistan,” Roggio told lawmakers, adding in his written testimony:

Al-Qaeda’s footprint inside Afghanistan remains a direct threat to U.S. national security and, with the resurgence of the Taliban, it is a threat that is only growing stronger. Al-Qaeda’s presence in Afghanistan has not occurred in a vacuum. It has maintained its strength in the country since the U.S. invasion, launched a new branch, AQIS [al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent], and established training camps with the help and support of the Taliban.

Roggio testified alongside Dr. Seth Jones from the RAND Corporation and Dr. Vanda Felbab-Brown from the Brookings Institution.

Echoing the U.S. military, the experts told lawmakers that Russia and Afghanistan’s neighbor Iran are providing military assistance to the Taliban, adding that neighboring Pakistan provides sanctuary to the terrorist group as well as its al-Qaeda and Haqqani Network allies.

According to the Pentagon, the Haqqani Network poses the “primary threat” to the American military in Afghanistan.

The experts noted that a U.S. military withdrawal from the war-devastated country would spell trouble for America’s national security.

The United States has already invested nearly $120 billion in nation-building efforts in the country.

Despite the threat posed by the Afghan Taliban, the group is not officially listed as a terrorist group by the United States like its ally al-Qaeda and its rival ISIS.

Roggio pointed out that although ISIS’s presence in Afghanistan is a problem, the Taliban remains a bigger threat.

ISIS is considered an enemy by both the al-Qaeda and the Taliban, considered the strongest group in the country.

“The reason the Taliban matters is the Taliban and al-Qaeda, they remain tied at the hip,” testified Roggio. “The Taliban refuse to surrender al-Qaeda members — Osama Bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. They continued to fight side by side. Al-Qaeda serves as a force multiplier.”

“The Islamic State is on the fringe. It’s a small problem in Afghanistan compared to al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and other Pakistani jihadist groups that operate there (in ISIS’ Afghan stronghold Nangarhar province),” he added. They operate primarily in four districts in Nangarhar province and have a minimal presence in the north, and it certainly is a problem.

This week, ISIS in Nangarhar killed two U.S. troops and wounded another, the Pentagon revealed.

“Our efforts seemed to be focused on the Islamic State at this point in time while largely ignoring what the Taliban is doing throughout the country and that is directly challenging the Afghan military. They’re going toe to toe; They’re raiding their bases; They’re taking control of territory,” said Roggio.</td>

WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on Thursday calling for an investigation into domestic and foreign steel production and, in part, its impact on defense.

“For decades, America has lost our jobs and our factories to unfair foreign trade. And one steel mill after another has been shut down, abandoned, and closed, and we’re going to reverse that,” said President Trump as he moved to sign the memorandum.

The President continued:

Today, I’m directing the Department of Commerce to immediately prioritize the investigation that began yesterday and really long before that — because Wilbur and I have been working on this for a long time — into foreign steel arriving into our markets, and to submit a report on the effects of these foreign steel products on the national security of the United States. It’s not just the pricing, it’s not just employment, it also has to do with the national security of our country, which people never talk about. I talked about it.

Leo Gerard of United Steelworkers addressed the President:

Mr. President, on behalf of the workers in the industry — President of the Steelworkers Union — I have worked a long time with Wilbur, and we’ve been fighting this unfair trade for more than 30 years. Hopefully, this executive order will give us the tools we need to grow our companies back and put people back to work. And I have lots of faith that Secretary Wilbur Ross will help make that happen.”

President Trump responded, “I have to say, the unions have been working with us very closely, and they’ve been great. So I appreciate that. Thank you very much.”

The White House announced on Thursday that with steel import rising, the need to examine foreign practices is urgent. The President is also seeking to put America’s steel industry first, a complement to his Buy American, Hire American executive order signed earlier this week. The White House made clear that this is in line with promises the now President made during his 2016 presidential campaign.

In a briefing ahead of the signing of the memorandum, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross informed reporters that on Wednesday night the Department of Commerce initiated an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, 19USC1962. Ross explained that this “authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to conduct comprehensive investigations to determine the effects of imports of any particular item into the United States on the security of the country.” He said this has been invoked before, notably in regards to the Arab Oil Crisis.

He listed the areas the investigation will look at: domestic production needed to meet national defense requirements, the industry’s capacity to meet such requirements, related human and material resources, importation of quantity and use of goods, close relation of national economic welfare to national security, loss of skills and investment, substantial unemployment, decrease in government revenue and impact of foreign competition on specific domestic industries and impact of displacement by excessive imports.

Anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases present a problem according to Ross. They are “very, very limited in nature to a very, very specific product from a very, very specific country.” However, the Trump Administration wants to see if facts warrant a more comprehensive solution to deal with a very wide range of steel products and very wide range of countries.

Ross quoted Trump’s remarks from back during the 2016 presidential campaign, “Foreign nations are dumping vast amounts of steel all over the united states which essentially is killing our steelworkers and steel companies. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. We’re going to use American steel, we’re going to use American labor, we’re gonna come first in all deals.”

“In the first couple months of this year alone steel imports rose 19.6 percent year over year and are now more than 26 percent of the entire U.S. marketplace so it’s a very serious impact on the domestic industry,” said Ross.

The investigation is required to be completed within 270 days, but Ross expects the completion to come a lot sooner. One or more public hearings will be held over the course of carrying out the memorandum.

The memorandum in its entirety reads as follows:

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE SUBJECT: Steel Imports and Threats to National Security By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, it is hereby directed as follows: Section 1. Policy. Core industries such as steel (including specialty steel unique to defense applications), aluminum, vehicles, aircraft, shipbuilding, and semiconductors are critical elements of our manufacturing and defense industrial bases, which we must defend against unfair trade practices and other abuses. In the case of steel, both the United States and global markets for steel products are distorted by large volumes of excess capacity ?? much of which results from foreign government subsidies and other unfair practices. The United States has placed more than 150 antidumping and countervailing duty orders on steel products, but they have not substantially alleviated the negative effects that unfairly traded imports have had on the United States steel industry. Repeated efforts by the United States to encourage other countries to reduce and address the underlying causes of excess capacity in the steel market have had little meaningful effect. The artificially low prices caused by excess capacity and unfairly traded imports suppress profits in the American steel industry, which discourages long-term investment in the industry and hinders efforts by American steel producers to research and develop new and better grades of steel. If the present situation continues, it may place the American steel industry at risk by undermining the ability of American steel producers to continue investment and research and development, and by reducing or eliminating the jobs needed to maintain a pool of skilled workers essential for the continued development of advanced steel manufacturing. Sec. 2. Investigation. The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has initiated an investigation under section 232(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (the “Act”) (19 U.S.C. 1862(b)(1)(A)) to determine the effects on national security of steel imports. In conducting this investigation, and in accordance with section 232(d) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1862(d)), the Secretary shall, as appropriate and consistent with law: (a) consider the domestic production of steel needed for projected national defense requirements; the capacity of domestic industries to meet such requirements; the existing and anticipated availabilities of the human resources, products, raw materials, and other supplies and services essential to the national defense; the requirements of growth of such industries and such supplies and services, including the investment, exploration, and development necessary to assure such growth; and the importation of goods in terms of their quantities, availabilities, character, and use as those affect such industries and the capacity of the United States to meet national security requirements; (b) recognize the close relation of the Nation’s economic welfare to our national security, and consider the effect of foreign competition in the steel industry on the economic welfare of domestic industries; (c) consider any substantial unemployment, decrease in government revenues, loss of skills or investment, or other serious effects resulting from the displacement of any domestic products by excessive steel imports; and (d) consider the status and likely effectiveness of efforts of the United States to negotiate a reduction in the levels of excess steel capacity worldwide. Sec. 3. Submit Report and Provide Recommendations. (a) The Secretary shall, consistent with applicable law, proceed expeditiously in conducting the investigation described in section 2 of this memorandum and shall submit to the President a report on the findings. (b) Pursuant to section 232(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1862(b)), if the Secretary finds that steel is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security, the Secretary shall, in the report submitted under subsection (a) of this section, recommend actions and steps that should be taken to adjust steel imports so that they will not threaten to impair the national security. Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Los Angeles, the second largest city in the U.S. with 4 million inhabitants, has its share of problems: A crisis with an exploding homeless population, rising violent crime rate, around-the-clock gridlock, deteriorating and potholed roads, and air pollution so bad that a word — “smog” — was invented for it.

But with all these pressing issues at hand, the L.A. city council found time to dive into foreign policy and demand an investigation into President Donald Trump, hoping to find impeachable offenses to remove him from office.

On Friday, the city council voted 10-0 to pass a resolution asking Congress to investigate whether Trump violated the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause or committed any other high crimes and misdemeanors that could lead to impeachment.

The impetus for this resolution is Trump’s relationship with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte as a new 57-story Trump Tower in Manila is set to open soon. The hotel was conceived and under construction well before Trump ran for president. But what any of this has to do with Los Angeles is unclear.

What’s clear is this: the resolution has zero legal weight, even a representative for city councilman Bob Blumenfield, who authored the resolution, said so. “It’s putting the city of L.A. on record to investigate Trump,” according to Jake Flynn, Blumenfield’s spokesman.

Of the 14 current L.A. city council members (one vacant), 13 are Democrats. Three of them were absent from Friday’s vote. The council’s lone Republican, Mitch Englander, who represents north San Fernando Valley, missed the vote on purpose.

“I walked out because I did not feel that voting to impeach a president was under the purview of the Los Angeles City Council,” Englander told the L.A. Times. “We should be focusing on public safety, fixing our roads and cleaning up our neighborhoods.”</td>

Attorney Harmeet Dhillon, who is representing the Berkeley College Republicans in their free speech case against the University of California, Berkeley over failing to allow Ann Coulter to speak on campus on equal terms, slammed the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for ignoring the case.”

“I don’t see the ACLU here in this room, which is unfortunate,” Dillon said, after listing several prominent Democrats who join her in opposing Berkeley’s efforts to restrict Coulter’s speech.

Asked whether there was “something special” about suing UC Berkeley, the home of the Free Speech Movement, Dillon answered:

“I never thought I’d be on the same side of an issue as Willie Brown, Bernie Sanders, Bill Maher, Keith Ellison, and every other person who’s a lawyer. Now, there are some amateur lawyers, like Howard Dean, who looks up a case on the Internet and then thinks he’s a Supreme Court scholar — and, you know, some of our members of Congress who play lawyers on TV, apparently. But no, I think I don’t know any lawyers, serious lawyers practicing constitutional law, who think that this is appropriate.

“And I have had dozens and dozens of emails and calls from lawyers who don’t know me, around the country. They all start with, ‘I don’t support what Ann Coulter says, but,” you know, or, ‘I hate what Donald Trump stands for, but you’re absolutely right on this, and this cannot stand.’

“And nor should it stand if it were happening on a conservative college campus and it were liberal students whose views were being marginalized.”

She noted that her passion for free speech issues was born when she was a student at Dartmouth, when some students were expelled for criticizing a music professor in print.

“Who represented us in the hinterlands of New Hampshire? The American Civil Liberties Union came in to represent my colleagues on the Dartmouth Review.”

She remarked, in that context, that the ACLU’s absence at Berkeley was noteworthy.

As Breitbart News noted last month, Dhillon once served on the board of the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the ACLU.

She is a noted Trump supporter, and serves as the vice chair of the California Republican Party. She is reportedly under consideration to be named to lead the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.

Dhillon is also representing Trump supporters who were attacked by anti-Trump rioters outside a Trump rally in their lawsuit against the city of San Jose for failing to protect them from the mob.

Critics say the ACLU has been drifting in a left direction for many years, often abandoning its absolute adherence to basic civil liberties in favor of a state-centered, redistributionist, and identify-inflected concept of rights.

Stephen Colbert has come under fire on social media for a crude joke he made about President Donald Trump on Monday’s broadcast of The Late Show that some critics claimed was bigoted and homophobic.

While attempting to defend his CBS colleague John Dickerson, Colbert said Trump’s mouth is only “good for is being Vladimir Putin’s c*ck holster.”

Outraged by the remark, social media users quickly made the hashtag #FireColbert a top trending topic on Twitter Tuesday.

“Colbert’s homophobic rant was disgusting and we won’t tolerate this anti-LGBTQ behavior,” one user wrote.

“Liberals ruin the careers of conservatives all the time, so the #FireColbert campaign is just giving libs a taste of their own medicine,” argued another.

Some called Colbert a “homophobe” and a “bigot.”

So, Colbert is saying homophobic things again? Disappointing that CBS supports and empowers this. #firecolbert — Michael Oxley (@Truthchampion16) May 2, 2017

I don't know that it was homophobic, but Colbert's comment was very inappropriate and not funny enough to be worth the risk #firecolbert — Kimbro13 (@kimbro1360) May 2, 2017

Some social media users called for a boycott of CBS and the network’s advertisers.

Time for him to go. Total trash. I will boycott advertisers. #FireColbert — hank_1972 (@Hank_1972) May 3, 2017

German Lopez, a reporter for left-wing news outlet Vox, wrote that Colbert’s joke pointedly mocked gay people.

“In a setting in which Colbert is deliberately trying to find a way to insult Trump, it’s telling that he resorts to suggesting that Trump is engaging in sexual acts with another man. The suggestion is that the worst thing that could happen for these men is if they engaged in homosexual acts together, as if that devalues them as men or emasculates them.”

Colbert’s over-the-top late-night monologue also included fat jokes about President Trump.

“Mr. President, I love your presidency. I call it ‘Disgrace the Nation,'” he began. “You’re not the POTUS; you’re the ‘BLOTUS.’ You’re the glutton with the button. You’re a regular ‘Gorge Washington.’ You’re the ‘presi-dunce’ but you’re turning into a real ‘prick-tator.’”

“Sir, you attract more skinheads than free Rogaine,” Colbert continued. “You have more people marching against you than cancer. You talk like a sign-language gorilla that got hit in the head.”

Colbert did not address the firestorm surrounding his comments during Tuesday night’s episode of The Late Show, opting instead to continue to blast Trump and Putin.

The CBS host compared the president to author Stephen King, saying Trump just “makes things up.” He also aired a 30-second clip of Trump’s quotes taken out of context.

Colbert’s ratings have risen steadily since Inauguration Day. The CBS host has regularly beaten late-night rival Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show since January, though Fallon still usually leads in the adults 18-49 demographic.

Monday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed he sent a letter to 10 cities functioning as so-called “sanctuary cities,” which may be in violation of federal law.

Sessions warned a failure to respond to those letters could result in those cities losing their federal funding.

“Last year, the Obama administration sent out notices that people had to comply with this cooperative language in the law that was passed several years ago,” Sessions explained. “And we sent out a letter today to 10 cities that the Inspector General’s office last year said were potentially in violation of the law involving deportation in sanctuary cities. We expect them to respond. If they don’t respond, they should not receive the grants because the grants were issued on condition of cooperation.”

Sessions went on to add the Department of Justice hoped to get a response certifying those cities were not in violation of the law by June.

Two prominent north Texas Democrats are sounding the alarm on the threat of a politically-uncommon concern: voter fraud.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) and State Representative Eric Johnson (D-HD 100) submitted a letter Thursday to Dallas County Elections Administrator Toni Pippins-Poole after public concerns continued to mount about scores of reports involving a potential absentee voter fraud scheme.

“According to reports, dozens of voters received mail-in ballots they never requested,” the letter states, which “suggests the possibility of a coordinated effort to benefit a candidate or candidates in the upcoming Dallas City Council elections.”

As Breitbart Texas previously reported, the episode began when West Dallas-area pastor James Armstrong alerted local media and officials alike that some of his congregants came forward with evidence that absentee ballots were arriving at their respective homes without first asking for them, as Texas law requires.

“It’s just a travesty that we are dealing with this,” Armstrong told NBC DFW at the time. “Seniors who have lived in this neighborhood all of their life and are now being taken advantage of.”

Another community resident, Alice Washington, 81, lodged similar complaints with the County via her niece, Barbara Roberson.

“I said, ‘Would you please send me a copy of that application because I’d like to see her signature’,” Roberson told WFAA at the time. “Someone forged her signature,” said Roberson after review of the paperwork.

In the week following, dozens of similar complaints have been made, according to Mayor Rawlings’ joint letter. The duo also notes a possible pattern in recent elections:

What’s more startling is that this is the second time in less than a year that we have heard reports of irregularities in West Dallas. In November, media reports indicated someone fraudulently mailed ballots for dozens of elderly or dead voters.

Previous Breitbart Texas coverage noted where election integrity experts explained root causes for the latest episode and steps Texas can take to fix the matter going forward:

Election integrity advocates have argued that absentee ballot problems can sometimes be rooted in poor maintenance of the underlying voter records. The Public Interest Legal Foundation noted in response to the Dallas episode that Texas should consider tightening procedures for requesting absentee ballots. “As long as you have a name and address of another voter, you’re good to go … You don’t even need to give a birth date,” a group spokesperson told Lifezette. Analysts say that requiring absentee ballot applications to include driver’s license or other government-issued identification numbers could cut down impersonation attempts like claimed by the Washington family.

Recent fraud conspiracies prosecuted in southern Texas point to a possible example for how elderly voters are preyed upon through the mail voting system. After an unsolicited ballot arrives, an illicit get-out-the-vote political operative would visit the recipient’s home, offering “assistance” with completing and returning form with pre-selected candidates in mind. One recent Texas case involved a U.S. Postal Service delivery man taking bribes in trade for allowing “politiqueras” to follow his truck, indicating which homes received ballots. The mailman also allegedly took part in campaigning for local Democrat candidates while in uniform as well.

Short of legislative reforms, Mayor Rawlings and Rep. Johnson were left to implore Pippins-Poole to “devote additional resources to verify the integrity of each mail-in ballot in Dallas.”

President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have steered a course during the administration’s first 100 days that anti-abortion activists have been dreaming about for decades.

“I think if you looked ten years ago, and you asked the question, ‘Will Planned Parenthood be defunded in the next decade?’ everyone would have said, ‘No,’” Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) President Marjorie Dannenfelser tells Breitbart News. “But the presidency of Donald Trump and the vice presidency of Mike Pence have changed all that.”

The pro-life base of the Republican Party saw the beginnings of change from the start of Trump’s presidency.

Within days of his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order that reinstated the Mexico City Policy, a rule that bans non-governmental organizations (NGOs) receiving U.S. funds – including International Planned Parenthood – from providing or promoting abortions overseas.

The administration, however, not only reinstated the policy – which other Republican presidents have done – but also updated it by directing the secretary of state to expand it across all global health assistance funding, a move that ensures taxpayer funds will not support organizations that promote or participate in the management of a coercive abortion program. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), for example, is one such organization, with its long history of supporting China’s one-child population control program, an agenda that has included forced abortions.

Later in January, Trump tweeted his personal support for the March for Life – the world’s largest pro-life demonstration – which convenes in Washington, DC, each year on the anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision:

The #MarchForLife is so important. To all of you marching — you have my full support! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017

Pro-life activists, however, had even more reason to rejoice when Pence, a champion of the movement, became the first vice president to address the March for Life.

The vice president will also serve as the keynote speaker of SBA List’s 10th annual gala on May 3.

It was Dannenfelser who led the coalition that met with Trump and Pence during the campaign to outline a pro-life agenda for a Trump administration, which included four policy commitments in a letter to pro-life leaders:

Nominating pro-life justices to the U.S. Supreme Court

Signing into law the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would end painful late-term abortions nationwide

Defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions, and reallocating their funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care for women

Making the Hyde Amendment permanent law to protect taxpayers from having to pay for abortions

Trump has already started on the path to fulfilling his promise to nominate pro-life justices to the Supreme Court. National anti-abortion leaders hailed the newly confirmed Justice Neil Gorsuch as “reminiscent” of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who regularly applied an originalist approach to the Constitution. The nomination led some pro-life leaders to praise Trump as a “man of his word.”

Dannenfelser explains that much has changed in the anti-abortion movement within the past decade because the “horrendous underbelly” of Planned Parenthood has been exposed.

“And it wasn’t exposed for decades,” she says. “They were the Teflon organization; no one could touch them. President George H.W. Bush was part of the reason for the original funding of Planned Parenthood.”

The national pro-life leader says Planned Parenthood – the nation’s largest abortion provider – had for decades been likened to “the Red Cross” or a “nurses’ organization administering to suffering people.”

“Nobody wanted to touch that,” she explains. “So, clearly, there has been a turn in the understanding of what this organization is about. It took a lot of brave people who were willing to be slandered to question that.”

Recently, for example, California prosecutors charged the Center for Medical Progress video makers – who recorded Planned Parenthood officials allegedly selling the harvested body parts of aborted babies for a profit – with 15 felonies. The charges continue a long string of attacks by the abortion giant and its political and media allies against activists exposing its operations.

The Trump administration reportedly unofficially informed Planned Parenthood it would have to cease performing abortions to keep its taxpayer funding. House Republican leaders – with support from the Trump administration – put forward the American Health Care Act (AHCA), legislation that contained a provision to defund Planned Parenthood for a one-year period. Though conservatives were successful in thwarting the bill because it failed to fully repeal Obamacare, Trump would likely have signed it if Congress had passed it, ending Planned Parenthood’s funding for a year. Pro-life leaders now hope Congress will put forward a single reconciliation bill to defund Planned Parenthood.

Two weeks ago, Trump also signed a resolution that overturns former President Barack Obama’s rule that forced states to provide family planning grants under Title X to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. The measure passed the House but required Pence as vice president to break the tie vote in the Senate due to the votes against it by Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).

Trump, formerly pro-choice, acknowledges he has adopted the pro-life view. Some concerns have arisen, however, about the influence his daughter Ivanka – an apparent supporter of Planned Parenthood – would have on the president’s pro-life agenda.

Several weeks ago, a report surfaced that Ivanka held an “under-the-radar” meeting with Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards to discuss possible “common ground” on the abortion issue.

Asked whether she views Ivanka’s perhaps more conciliatory tone toward Planned Parenthood as a threat to the future of the pro-life agenda, Dannenfelser quickly dismisses the idea.

“I really do think this president understands what it is about – his commitments, his promises. And he’s got a vice president who knows how to lead the way legislatively,” she says. “I’m not concerned.”</td>

More Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 live with their parents than with a spouse, according to a new study.

In 1975, 31.9 million young people lived with a spouse, compared to just 19.9 million in 2016, while the number of young people staying with their parents has risen from 14.7 million to 22.9 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Despite this vast difference, the number of young unmarried partners living together has risen from around 700,000 to over 9.2 million, while the number of young people living alone has also gone up from 5 percent to 8 percent.

“What does it mean to be a young adult? In prior generations, young adults were expected to have finished school, found a job, and set up their own household during their 20s—most often with their spouse and with a child soon to follow,” explained the Census Bureau study. “Today’s young adults take longer to experience these milestones.”

“What was once ubiquitous during their 20s is now not commonplace until their 30s. Some demographers believe the delays represent a new period of the life course between childhood and adulthood, a period of ’emerging adulthood’ when young people experience traditional events at different times and in a different order than their parents did,” they continued. “What is clear is that today’s young adults look different from prior generations in almost every regard: how much education they have, their work experiences, when they start a family, and even who they live with while growing up.”

The report also added, “More young men are falling to the bottom of the income ladder,” pointing out that “In 1975, only 25 percent of men, aged 25 to 34, had incomes of less than $30,000 per year.”

“By 2016, that share rose to 41 percent of young men (incomes for both years are in 2015 dollars),” they continued. “There are now more young women than young men with a college degree, whereas in 1975 educational attainment among young men outpaced that of women.”

The majority of states with the highest number of young people staying with their parents were predominantly coastal.

New Jersey took the top position with 46.9 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds staying at home, followed by Connecticut (41.6 percent), New York (40.6 percent), Maryland (38.5 percent), Florida (38.3 percent), and California (38.1 percent).

At the bottom with the least amount of young people living with their parents was North Dakota with 14.1 percent, following by South Dakota (19.9 percent), Wyoming (20.9 percent), Nebraska (22.7 percent), Iowa (22.8 percent), Montana (24.1 percent), and Colorado (24.6 percent).

On Friday’s “CBS This Morning,” Senator Bernie Sanders stated that he thinks it’s “unfortunate” President Obama is speaking at a Wall Street investment bank for $400,000, “and I would have hoped that the president would not have given a speech like this.”

Sanders said, “Look, President Obama’s a friend of mine. I think he, as president, represented the country with integrity and intelligence, but I think at a time when people are so frustrated with the power of Wall Street and the big money interests, I think it is unfortunate that President Obama doing this. You know, right now you have President Trump’s key economic adviser, as you know, he’s Gary Cohn, former President of Goldman Sachs, a firm that paid $5 billion in federal fines because of illegal behavior. Wall Street has incredible power, and I would have hoped that the president would not have given a speech like this.”

In a major move on the GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, the conservative Freedom Caucus of the House of Representatives has announced its endorsement of the latest bill after New Jersey Republican Tom MacArthur introduced substantive changes.

The Freedom Caucus was a key voice against the bill introduced by the Republican leadership last month, causing House Speaker Paul Ryan to pull the bill from consideration. But since Ryan’s failure to pass the bill, Republicans have been negotiating amendments to make it more attractive to conservatives.

Days ago House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) told Breitbart News that he expected an Obamacare repeal bill to pass by the end of May, and now the group has announced its support of the newest measure.

NEWS: Freedom Caucus announces support for AHCA with Rep. MacArthur's amendment included. Statement: https://t.co/MD3NXpiPQ8 — House Freedom Caucus (@freedomcaucus) April 26, 2017

The group said in a Wednesday press release:

Over the past couple of months, House conservatives have worked tirelessly to improve the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to make it better for the American people. Due to improvements to the AHCA and the addition of Rep. Tom MacArthur’s proposed amendment, the House Freedom Caucus has taken an official position in support of the current proposal. The MacArthur amendment will grant states the ability to repeal cost driving aspects of Obamacare left in place under the original AHCA. While the revised version still does not fully repeal Obamacare, we are prepared to support it to keep our promise to the American people to lower healthcare costs. We look forward to working with our Senate colleagues to improve the bill. Our work will continue until we fully repeal Obamacare.

We will work with our Senate colleagues to improve the AHCA. Our work will continue until we fully repeal Obamacare. https://t.co/MD3NXpiPQ8 — House Freedom Caucus (@freedomcaucus) April 26, 2017

Liberals in the U.S. Senate have vowed to oppose any moves to change Obamacare. New Jersey Democrat Senator Chris Murphy’s reaction was representative of that sentiment when he called the Republican bill a “dumpster fire” early in March.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Christian religion in the Muslim-majority North African country of Libya has disappeared, declared an expert from United Kingdom-based University of Sussex.

“We have lost the Christian presence in Libya,” said Professor Mariz Tadros during a Christian persecution conference on Thursday at the National Press Club.

“Religious pluralism as it existed [in Libya] is over,” she added.

We often focus on violence, but the daily pressures of religious tensions can be just as destructive – Mariz Tadros #RespondUCS pic.twitter.com/UDwHOoNXzO — RFI (@RFInstitute) April 20, 2017

Before the 2011 revolution that resulted in the overthrow and execution of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, as many as 100,000 Christians, mainly members of the Coptic Church, resided in Libya, reported Agence France-Presse (AFP).

As of 2013, before the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) appeared in the North African nation, “a few thousand” Christians remained, added AFP, citing church officials.

At one point, Libya’s coastal city of Sirte, where Gaddafi was killed, was ISIS’s largest stronghold outside of its so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria.

ISIS jihadists targeted members of the Christian minority in Libya as it did in other countries.

In February 2015, the terrorist group decapitated 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians on a Libyan beach, prompting worldwide condemnation.

“These beheadings accounted for a mere twenty-one of the 7,100 Christians whom Open Doors estimates died for their faith in 2015,” points out a report released by the University of Notre Dame’s Under Caesar’s Sword project on global Christian communities during the conference Thursday.

The report, titled “In Response to Persecution,” assessed Libya to host a “high” level of Christian persecution.

“Christians face violence at the hands of Muslim militants. Especially in Egypt and Libya, this violence has increased as a result of the ‘Arab Uprisings’ of 2011,” it notes adding:

While Christians generally enjoyed freedom from heavy discrimination and a decent level of liberty to worship and practice under the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, Christians’ security disappeared when this dictator fell and Libya was beset with lawlessness. Militias and tribal groups were empowered, including Muslim groups like Ansar al Shariah, al-Nusra, the Islamic State, and the Muslim Brotherhood. At their hands, Christians suffered assaults on churches, violence against clergy, abductions, and numerous other forms of violence.

Libya has been gripped by chaos since the fall of Gaddafi, providing fertile grounds for jihadists to flourish.

While the persecution report mentions that Christians still make up “between 3 percent and 5 percent of the population and are mostly migrant workers from outside the country,” the Open Doors USA organization estimates that less than one percent (20,000) of the Muslim-majority country’s 6.4 million people are Christians.

“As anarchy took hold in Libya, many Copts and other Christians at first tried to avoid abductions while remain-ing in the country, often living like fugitives,” notes the report released Thursday. “Eventually, a mass exodus ensued, with more than 200,000 Christians leaving Libya between 2011 and 2015, it is estimated.”</td>

New York Times readers are deserting in droves in protest that its new columnist, Bret Stephens, thinks incorrect thoughts about man-made global warming.

In his first column Stephens committed the cardinal sin of suggesting that maybe climate change isn’t quite the major existential threat that liberals have cracked up to be; and that maybe the environmentalists’ rabid zealotry is doing their cause more harm than good.

Claiming total certainty about the science traduces the spirit of science and creates openings for doubt whenever a climate claim proves wrong. Demanding abrupt and expensive changes in public policy raises fair questions about ideological intentions. Censoriously asserting one’s moral superiority and treating skeptics as imbeciles and deplorables wins few converts.

Mighty has been the progressives’ wrath.

According to Soros attack dog Joe Romm, it could scarcely have been worse if the New York Times had given the column to the former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, David Duke.

According to the Guardian‘s Dana Nucitelli, the most charitable thing you could say about Stephens’s piece is that it’s “ignorant and wrong.”

Professor Ken Caldeira, of the Carnegie Institute for Science, has publicly cancelled his NYT subscription.

So too has German climate professor Stefan Rahmsdorf, who wrote to complain:

My heroes are Copernicus, Galilei and Kepler, who sought the scientific truth based on observational evidence and defended it against the powerful authority of the church in Rome, at great personal cost. Had the New York Times existed then – would you have seen it as part of your mission to insult and denigrate these scientists, as Stephens has done with climate scientists?

Twitter has been outraged:

A New Yorker fact checker who understands what journalism is supposed to do pic.twitter.com/ZEIglfxd5x — David Klion (@DavidKlion) April 29, 2017

Meanwhile, a petition demanding that the New York Times “rescind” its job offer to Bret Stephens has attracted more than 28,000 signatures.

Truly you’d need a heart of stone not to laugh at the cruel irony of it all.

One of the reasons Stephens left his old home the Wall Street Journal to join David Brooks in the special padded cell the NYT retains for its house “conservatives” was to escape all the hate he was getting for his anti-Trump articles. Surely, he no doubt imagined, his gentle brand of centrist squishery – “the nambiest and the pambiest” as Dinesh D’Souza once referred to it – would find a more welcoming home among the impeccably reasonable, caring and sensitive liberal readership for which Pravda is famed.

It didn’t take long for Stephens to be disabused of this notion:

After 20 months of being harangued by bullying Trump supporters, I’m reminded that the nasty left is no different. Perhaps worse. https://t.co/uQ2L5lox6e — Bret Stephens (@BretStephensNYT) April 28, 2017

What, though, had Stephens actually said wrong to deserve all this hate? (Read the comment thread below his tweet. The Times’s Red Guard shows no mercy).

In short: nothing.

Such facts as there were in his comment piece – it was opinion, not a science report – were pretty unimpeachable, not to say uncontroversial. He quoted the IPCC – generally used by liberals as the gold standard of climate science.

He quoted another (more acceptably green/left-wing) New York Times columnist Andrew Revkin:

“I saw a widening gap between what scientists had been learning about global warming and what advocates were claiming as they pushed ever harder to pass climate legislation.”

But there was really nothing in the piece that was shockingly contentious or factually dubious.

Why then this brutal monstering?

Because climate change is a religion where heretics must burn.

At least that’s how progressives think – and it’s the progressives who still dictate the terms of the debate: they’ve hijacked the seats of learning, the newspapers, the TV, the schools, the political arena, the corporations, Wall Street…

Any form of dissent from the Green Religion, however trivial, has to be punished with fire and brimstone as a dread warning to anyone else tempted to diverge from the True Path.

This is not the first time this has happened.

Stephens’s experiences are strikingly similar to that of another very moderate skeptic, Roger Pielke Jr, who was recruited as a columnist for Nate Silver’s website 538 but was then ditched when readers objected to his non-alarmist views and his unhelpful references to data, truth and real-world evidence.

Facts are very important to progressive journalists and readers. But only when they are the right sort of facts. Otherwise they’re WrongThink.</td>

The Algemeiner reports: Leading American Jewish groups were quick to praise President Donald Trump’s forthright condemnation of antisemitism during a Holocaust commemoration speech earlier today.

Speaking on behalf of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Stephen Greenberg, its Chairman and Malcolm Hoenlein, its Executive Vice Chairman/CEO, noted appreciatively that Trump “clearly and forcefully condemned all forms of anti-Semitism, calling out Holocaust denial, threats to Israel’s existence, anti-Semitic discourse and rhetoric and attacks on Jewish communities.”

Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt commented, “It deeply matters that President Trump used the power of his office to stand against anti-Semitism and hate and to honor the memory of the six million Jews and millions of others murdered in Europe.” Greenblatt encouraged Trump to “continue to use his bully pulpit to speak out against anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hatred in all forms. We urge the president and his administration to act to protect targeted communities against hate crime and discrimination.”

STOCKHOLM (AFP) — A Swedish court on Tuesday sentenced three young men to prison for gang raping a woman and livestreaming the attack on Facebook.

Reza Mohammed Ahmadi, 21, was sentenced to two years and four months in prison for rape and accessory to rape, while Maysam Afshar, 18, was sentenced to one year in prison for rape, a reduced sentence because of his age.

Both are Afghan citizens who have been granted residency in Sweden.

Emil Khodagholi, a 21-year-old Swedish citizen, was sentenced to six months in prison for aggravated defamation for posting the rape on Facebook, and for failing to report it.

The men were arrested in the town of Uppsala northwest of Stockholm on January 22 after members of a closed Facebook group, which has 60,000 members, saw the attack streamed live and alerted police.

The film has since been removed from Facebook but it has been circulated on the internet.

Swedish prosecutors argued that Khodagholi had encouraged his friends, and “laughed and in close proximity filmed the incident with his mobile phone, and posted it live or very shortly after the rape on Facebook.”

All three denied committing any crime. Ahmadi and Afshar admitted having sex with the woman but said it was consensual.

Khodagholi argued he was not the only one to film the events, and claimed he was unaware the victim did not want the images to be public.

But prosecutors said the woman was “heavily drunk” and “under the influence of drugs”, which the men must have also noticed, the Uppsala district court said in a statement.

“It’s not possible for a person in such a situation to consent (to sex),” judge Nils Palbrant said in a statement.

The men were also ordered to pay damages totalling 335,000 kronor ($38,000, 34,850 euros) to the victim.</td>

STOCKHOLM (AFP) — Sweden on Thursday announced tougher measures against illegal immigration, weeks after the main suspect behind the deadly Stockholm attack was identified as an Uzbek who had ignored a deportation order.

Slammed for having failed to expel 39-year-old Rakhmat Akilov, who had gone underground after being denied a residency permit in 2016, the government vowed to take action.

The proposal, which is likely to pass in the parliament, will allow police to carry out surprise inspections at workplaces and double the amount of fines for hiring illegal immigrants.

Police will also be able to take fingerprints within Swedish borders during identity checks to better track down people who have received deportation orders.

“It’s going to hurt employers who take advantage of these people who often find themselves in a vulnerable situation,” Justice Minister Morgan Johansson told a news conference in Stockholm.

A company found to have hired ten illegal immigrants will face a fine of nearly 900,000 kronor (93,000 euros, $102,000), Johansson added.

The government wants the new measures to take effect on March 1 next year.

The Swedish Migration Agency estimates that around 33,000 people who have been denied a residency permit will continue to stay illegally in Sweden between 2017 and 2019.

By the end of 2016, Swedish police were looking for more than 12,000 undocumented migrants. Search notices are valid for four years, after which it’s possible to reapply for a residency permit.

Akilov has confessed to driving the stolen truck that mowed down pedestrians on a busy shopping street in Stockholm on April 7, killing four people and injuring 15 others.

Although no terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack, its method resembled that used in Nice, Berlin and London.

Swedish authorities said Akilov is known to have shown sympathies for jihadists groups, including the Islamic State (IS).</td>

Reports of the number of layoffs to befall employees at cable sports network ESPN have been steadily increasing, but no one expected that the full measure would amount to 100 employees. The shocking toll was realized today as employees began receiving their pink slips.

Weeks ago some reports speculated that as many as 40 employees would be shown the door, and on Tuesday some were raising that ceiling to perhaps 70. But, as April 26 dawned, the final number was revealed with a whopping 100 employees fired.

ESPN President John Skipper sent out the feared memo on Wednesday informing employees that the time had come. About half of those let go are on-air, well-known names to ESPN fans.

One of the first to alert fans to his fate was on-air reporter Ed Werder, who took to Twitter to tell the sorry tale.

After 17 years reporting on #NFL, I've been informed that I'm being laid off by ESPN effective immediately. I have no plans to retire — Ed Werder (@Edwerderespn) April 26, 2017

Among the many others fired are hockey writers Pierre LeBrun, Scott Burnside and Joe McDonald, college reporter Dana O’Neil, and soccer reporter Mike L. Goodman, according to the New York Post.

Other on-air employees taking reduced roles and reduced paychecks at the sports network including Hannah Storm, Karl Ravech, and ESPN Radio’s Ryen Russillo.

The layoffs come just ahead of Disney’s second-quarter financial report and on the heels of the company’s announcement of a major deficit due to high costs of keeping the sports cable network afloat.

The 38-year-old sports network has steadily lost ground and profitability, losing over 10,000 subscribers a month while saddled with hundreds of millions in broadcast fees levied by the various national leagues. ESPN also has reportedly lost over 12 million subscribers over the last five years.

Democrats working to oppose any Republican-sponsored changes to Obamacare have launched a morbid campaign to fight the GOP’s American Health Care Act (AHCA) by urging supporters to send the ashes of dead relatives to Washington, DC.

“Millions of Americans rely on protections and coverage from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare,” the campaign website insists. “The Republicans [sic] new bill will gut these protections and many will die.”

The site then urges supporters to gather the ashes of dead people and send them along to any Republican member of Congress.

The effort is the vision of college junior Zoey Jordan Salsbury, an employee of a Democrat strategy company called New Blue Interactive:

@nsilverberg I made a website for sick people to send their ashes to a GOP member of congress because of this tweet: https://t.co/AKac7UgroH — Zoey Jordan Salsbury (@zoeyjsalsbury) May 4, 2017

Despite the initial claim, however, Salsbury told the Washington Post that she does not really intend to send any ashes to D.C.

“I have the feeling the Capitol building would actually stop” the packages, Salsbury told the paper.

But she did say that instead of sending the ashes to Congress, supporters should send them to the district offices back home in any particular congressman’s state.

Salsbury is worried that the GOP’s “repeal” of Obamacare will impact people with pre-existing conditions, but the GOP’s AHCA does not roll back any of the protections for pre-existing conditions, nor does it “repeal” Obamacare in any meaningful way.

During her opening statement on Saturday’s edition of the Fox News Channel’s “Justice,” Judge Jeanine Pirro ripped into 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton after she blamed WikiLeaks and Jim Comey’s letter on October 28th for losing the election to President Donald Trump.

Judge Jeanine called Clinton a “loser” and told her to go back into hiding.

“Hillary, snap out of it,” Pirro said. “I’m tired of going through this with you. You’re a two-time loser who lost because you were a lousy candidate, you didn’t have a message, you lied every time you opened your mouth; you didn’t know what states to campaign in, you put our national security at risk with your amateur email setup, you were in a foundation that was nothing more than an organized criminal enterprise parading as a charity, four men died under your watch as you lied about a video, and there [were] a billion dollars missing from the State Department when you left. And I could go on and on, but I just don’t have the time. So, stop with the poor me nonsense. We’ve had it with you Clintons always claiming victimhood. The two of you haven’t followed the rules since the day you both showed up in your bell bottoms in Arkansas.”

She later warned, “Be careful, Hillary. Be very, very careful. You pulled the wool over Jim Comey’s eyes once, and you actually got the president to say you’re a nice lady. Don’t be so sure you’re going to get away with your new game, given your illegal, ill-advised, and incompetent instincts. You’re a loser, Hillary. Face it. Face it, and get back in the woods!”

Former U.N. ambassador John Bolton took stock of President Trump’s foreign policy on Thursday’s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.

“The president, during the campaign, always talked about an America First foreign policy. What he said expressly he meant by that was that American national interests have to dominate what a president does – not abstract ideas about the way the world order should look, but concentrating on threats to America and dealing with them,” Bolton recalled.

“In the case of Syria, as we’ve discussed before, I think a lot of people were worried that the retaliation for the chemical weapons attack was just the first step toward a much greater involvement in the Syrian conflict. Those who wanted that said there was a change of policy, and they liked it. Those who opposed it said there was a change in policy and they didn’t like it,” he said.

“But, in fact, I don’t really think there was a change in policy,” Bolton continued. “I think this was a response to the use of chemical weapons, just as we would respond if it were nuclear weapons or biological weapons. It’s a threat to American national security when anybody uses weapons of mass destruction. So Trump’s response – which so far, at least, has been confined to the one strike at the Syrian airbase, although obviously, it took place in Syria – was not a shift in policy on the civil war.”

“Then when you look at Korea – look, this is one of the consequences of eight years of Obama’s failed foreign policy. He pursued what he called ‘strategic patience’ vis-a-vis the North Korean nuclear program, which was nothing more than a synonym for doing nothing at all. The consequences are right before us: the North Koreans are now very close to being able to drop a ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead on a U.S. target,” he said.

“I think Trump’s response was entirely appropriate,” he argued. “I think where he has not stepped up to the plate yet, at least his administration hasn’t, is the Iranian nuclear weapons program. Despite his very strong view during the campaign that the Obama nuclear deal was a debacle, just yesterday Secretary of State Tillerson signed a letter to Speaker Ryan, in compliance with the congressional reporting requirement, saying Iran was in compliance with the deal.”

Bolton said this assessment of Iranian compliance was “just patently false.”

“Now, they say the NSC is reviewing it. They’re looking at further sanctions because of Iran’s terrorist activity, but there’s plenty of evidence out there already publicly that Iran is violating the deal,” he contended. “It’s not just a problem, as Tillerson said later in the day, that ultimately, the deal just delays Iran’s nuclear weapon; it doesn’t prevent it. It doesn’t delay it, either, if they’re violating it, which I think they’re doing.”

Marlow highlighted Bolton’s recent New York Post editorial calling for the Trump administration to name and sanction Iranian terrorists and terror-supporting institutions.

“The Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, as its name implies, is the military wing of the Iranian theocracy, to guard the 1979 Islamic revolution there,” Bolton explained. “It reports directly to the supreme leader. Forget President Rouhani or the election coming up later this spring; the real ruler in Iran has always been the supreme leader, since the ’79 revolution.”

“The IRGC, as it’s called, is really the principal means by which the ayatollahs are trying to get a hegemony in the Middle East, through a variety of mechanisms. The Quds Force, which is really the tip of the spear, they were responsible in an earlier incarnation for the bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon going back to 1983. They’ve been killing Americans for a long time,” he said.

“The nuclear weapons program in Iran and the ballistic missile programs are under the control of the IRGC,” he said. “If we name them as a foreign terrorist organization, all kinds of statutory sanctions kick in. I think it will have a dramatic impact on the Iranian regime. Opponents of naming the IRGC as a terrorist organization include many in the administration who don’t want to admit Iran is violating the nuclear weapons deal and who are afraid that if we name the IRGC, that Iran will pull out of the deal.”

“What a shame if that were to happen!” Bolton added sarcastically.

“The point is, Iran’s behavior has not changed at all, despite what the Obama administration said all through the negotiations: if we can just solve this nuclear program, they’ll start behaving like a civilized nation. The ayatollahs have made a joke of that contention for the past now going on two years, since the deal was signed in 2015,” he said.

“I think there’s still hope for the Trump administration on this. Their utterly inexplicable finding that Iran is in compliance with the nuclear deal – I mean, that’s kind of an embarrassment. Fred Fleitz, a former colleague of mine, has an excellent article up on the Fox News opinion website on what’s wrong with that finding. I urge people to take a look at that. This has got to be stopped. Otherwise, I think it will risk embarrassing the Trump administration, given the president’s very strong stand against this deal in the campaign,” Bolton advised.

He said it was not surprising that the first mandated 90-day status report on the Iran nuclear deal from the Trump State Department would falsely declare compliance because “the State Department is almost genetically incapable of saying foreign governments actually violate their treaties.”

“I had this experience in arms control deals when I was in the Bush 43 State Department,” Bolton recalled. “I understand what Tillerson’s putting up with, but you’ve got to stand against this because just the inertia of the people who negotiated the deal, the people who supported it, are very reluctant to admit they were wrong and that Iran, in fact, is violating it because it’s a way of undercutting all of their efforts.”

“That’s what political appointees and presidential appointees are designed to do, to pierce through that bureaucratic inertia and get to the truth that the Iranians are violating it on the ballistic missile side, they’ve violated it on the heavy water side, they’ve violated it on the enriched uranium limits – and that’s just what’s been reported publicly,” he noted.

“What do we know, in fact, about Iranian cooperation with North Korea?” Bolton asked. “How much of the Iranian program is really being conducted in North Korea, where our intelligence is, unfortunately, even worse than it is inside Iran? There are a lot of questions here.”

“I think it was a mistake to certify compliance, but as I say, it’s exactly what the State Department did in the early Bush administration with the agreed framework with North Korea. Despite mounting evidence of North Korean violations, they kept wanting to certify that North Korea was in compliance. Eventually, we broke that. This game isn’t over yet, but that first certification was a disappointment,” he said.

Turning to North Korea, Bolton said the communist nation’s latest threats to unleash a “super-mighty preemptive strike” on the United States were standard rhetoric.

“Within the next few days, you can expect them to say they’ll unleash a ‘sea of fire’ across the Korean Peninsula,” he predicted. “They’ve got a whole handbook of these phrases that they use. This is how they talk before – at least we think before – they have the capability to launch ICBMs that can hit the United States.”

“Our troops in South Korea are vulnerable. They’ve got thousands of tons of chemical weapons. South Korean civilians are vulnerable. That’s why my view has long been that really the only solution to the nuclear problem in North Korea, and, in fact, the North Korean problem generally, is to reunify the peninsula. As long as this regime is in power, its irrational threats can someday actually come to fruition, with horrible consequences,” he warned.

“This regime is not going to change its behavior,” he stressed. “It has three times in the past 25 years made unequivocal statements it would give up its nuclear weapons program. It has violated them every time, usually before the ink was dry. That’s the pattern Iran is watching. They see this: there are no consequences really for North Korea. Even in the Bush administration, the administration lifted sanctions against North Korea that now we’re looking at reimposing. If this is the way North Korea behaves before they can hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, imagine how they’re going to behave once they’re able to.”

Bolton looked at the presidential race in France, judging it “very close, with several non-conventional candidates, to say the least, possibly making the two-person runoff.”

“I would guess, in a year or period when political opinion polling has not been exactly accurate, it’s going to be very hard to say with any certainty who comes out in the top two spots this coming Sunday. But it’s possible Marine Le Pen would be one, as you correctly say, and the other would be a candidate of the extreme left actually backed by the French Communist Party. Melenchon is his name,” he told Marlow.

“So you could have a runoff between these two candidates, neither of whom obviously represents one of the major standing French political parties of the center-right or the center-left. I think that is the kind of scenario – a proto-Communist, basically, versus Marine Le Pen – where she could win. In any event, no matter who the last two are, I think that things are so volatile in France and across the European Union that while I still think it’s unlikely Le Pen would win in the final round, I don’t think you can discount that yet,” said Bolton.

John Bolton is a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and head of his own political action committee, BoltonPAC.

Early Tuesday morning, a wave of Turkish airstrikes reportedly struck a headquarters building used by the Kurdish YPG militia in northeastern Syria. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 18 YPG fighters and media officials were killed in the attack.

Turkey also conducted airstrikes in the Sinjar region of Iraq, ostensibly aimed at the militant Kurdish separatists of the PKK. However, Kurdish Peshmerga forces in Iraq – another key U.S. military ally against the Islamic State – also said the Turks hit their positions, killing five of their troops.

The YPG released a statement saying its headquarters in Mount Karachok near the Syria-Turkey border was hit by Turkish planes, damaging a media center, radio broadcast facilities, and military installations.

The YPG described Turkey’s attack as “treacherous” and “barbaric” and even accused the Turks of attempting to undermine the planned offensive against Raqqa, the Syrian capital of the Islamic State. Critics of Turkey have accused it of tacitly supporting ISIS against the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria and of covertly profiting from trade with the Islamic State.

Syrian Kurdish leader Salih Muslim asked the United States to defend them against further Turkish strikes. “A people that is fighting terrorism is being stabbed in the back. Coalition forces must not remain silent against this. No one should accept these attacks,” Muslim said.

The Turkish military said these airstrikes were intended to stop the PKK from smuggling weapons into Turkey. A statement from the military described the targets as “terrorists” and “terror hubs.” According to the Turkish military, 70 militants were killed in the airstrikes.

The PKK recently claimed responsibility for a bomb attack on a police compound in southeastern Turkey that killed three people. The attackers dug a tunnel beneath the compound to plant what they described as “more than 2.5 tonnes of explosives.”

Turkey accuses other Kurdish forces, particularly the YPG in Syria, of being in league with the PKK. The PKK does have a presence in the Sinjar region, in part because it came to the aid of the Yazidi minority when ISIS tried to exterminate them. The PKK has been training and arming Yazidis to fight the Islamic State and has said it will not withdraw from Sinjar until Yazidi forces control the area.

The Kurdish administration has been urging Yazidis to join the Peshmerga and other militia units instead of the PKK. Peshmerga commanders have asked the PKK to withdraw from the area.

This is a difficult conflict for the United States to negotiate. On the one hand, Turkey is a NATO member and an important regional ally the U.S. is nervous about alienating. The U.S. classifies the PKK as a terrorist organization, just as Turkey does. On the other hand, the Peshmerga and YPG are crucial American battlefield allies against the Islamic State. The Peshmerga and YPG have also clashed among themselves, even while both cooperate with the United States.

American military officials reportedly visited the Mount Karachok region by helicopter on Tuesday to assess the damage from Turkey’s airstrikes. Turkey’s Daily Sabah, which has a pro-government bent, began its report on the visit by matter-of-factly stating the YPG is an “offshoot” of the PKK terrorist group and said banners depicting jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan can be seen in the background of photos that showed U.S. officials walking with YPG representatives.

The U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria issued a statement encouraging all forces in the region to “concentrate their efforts on ISIS and not toward objectives that may cause the Coalition to divert energy and resources away from the defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria.”

The Iraqi Foreign Ministry denounced Turkey’s strikes as a violation of its sovereignty, warned that a larger Turkish cross-border military incursion would “destabilize northern Iraq,” and asked the international community to block further “interference” by Turkey.</td>

Marine Le Pen’s globalist rival in the French presidential elections, Emmanuel Macron, has promised to rip up border controls in France, potentially opening Britain up to a new wave of illegal migration.

The establishment favourite in the French presidential race asserted that the Le Touquet treaty, under which Britain operates border controls in the migrant hotspot Calais, should be “back on the table”.

In an interview with TF1, the former Rothschild banker said the deal “must be renegotiated, especially the parts that deal with the fate of isolated child migrants.

“There is no easy solution to the migrant crisis. If there was one, it would have been found.”

Downing Street is likely to be concerned by the statement, as Macron had previously sworn to keep the migration agreement in place just two months ago, in talks with Prime Minister Theresa May.

He said: ‘If there was a simple answer [to Calais’ migrant crisis], it would have been found. I want to put the Touquet treaty back on the table and to renegotiate the agreement.”

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We have always been very clear that protecting and enhancing the shared border between the UK and France at Calais is in both the UK and France’s best interests.

A Conservative spokesman said: “This just shows that we need the strong and stable leadership of Theresa May, and why voters need to give her the best possible hand to negotiate in Europe.

“We have always been very clear that protecting and enhancing the shared border between the UK and France at Calais is in both the UK and France’s best interests. By contrast Jeremy Corbyn is not strong enough to keep our borders secure.”

French sociologist and writer Mathieu Bock-Côté has warned that Macron embodies “all that France wants to extricate itself from”.

“Excessive globalism and cultural leftism are in contradiction with the aspirations that seem to come from the depths of the country,” he wrote in Le Figaro.

The frontrunner in the election, Macron has previously declared that Europe has “entered a world of great migrations” inescapable for the continent, and which will only accelerate.</td>

Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) is singling out the H-1B visa program in a new op-ed for its harmful impact on American workers.

In a piece titled ‘Putting The American Worker First,’ Brat argues that the H-1B visa puts the need of foreign workers first, rather than Americans, by allowing businesses to bring in 85,000 new foreign workers every year, often taking once high-paying jobs from Americans who are fired and forced to train their replacements.

“One thing is clear: the United States’ immigration policy should serve first and foremost the interests of the American worker,” Brat begins the op-ed:

The current system for H-1B visa workers does not put the interests of our country first, and rampant abuses to the system leave the American worker standing on the sidelines and often underemployed. During a time of heightened political divides, this is an issue both Democrats and Republicans in Congress can agree needs to be addressed. Too often, companies capitalize on the loopholes in our immigration system to displace high-skilled American workers in search of cheap labor. I applaud the announcement of President Trump’s America First policy to return more American jobs to American workers by rooting out fraud, identifying necessary reforms and punishing companies exploiting the system for their own financial gain.

Brat touts his H-1B reform plan introduced with Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ), Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), and Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), where employers seeking foreign workers through the H-1B visa would have to raise the minimum wage for those workers, while also giving “investigative authority” to the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Labor to “find abuses and creates more defined allotment categories to prioritize STEM workers.”

The abuses of the H-1B visa at the expense of American workers have largely been silenced, according to Brat, as fired Americans are forced to sign agreements which mandates they not speak about the termination:

The outrage from laid-off American tech workers has been muted because companies frequently require employees to sign nondisclosure forms prohibiting them from criticizing their employers in exchange for severance pay. Last year, employees at Disney filed in federal court to sue outsourcing companies that contracted with American companies to supplant Americans with H-1B workers. And just last month, 60 Minutes aired an episode entitled “You’re Fired” that highlighted how the H-1B visa program is working against the American worker. The episode told the story of Robert Harrison, an engineer at a medical center in San Francisco. Last October, he was told along with 80 of his IT coworkers that they were being fired and replaced with international workers. These American workers were asked to train their replacements and promised generous bonuses. The American worker should be allowed to compete for positions before a company outsources the jobs to a foreign worker with an H-1B visa. The purpose of our immigration laws should be to protect the interests of our country and promote a thriving economy and productive citizens. Instead, the H-1B system has created an entire industry of foreign workers coming to the United States to be trained, and then the role is outsourced back to their country of origin for drastically lower wages. This practice eliminates many traditional entry-level positions for technical professionals in the United States.

Brat says that not only does the H-1B visa harm the millions of displaced Americans that it has impacted since its inception, but it “underpays and exploits foreign workers,” writing that the current GOP-led Congress and President Donald Trump’s administration must make major reforms to the program.

Trump’s newest executive order targets the H-1B visa for its abuses by U.S. companies, calling for a “full legal analysis” of the program by DOJ, DHS, and the Labor Department, as Breitbart Texas reported.

If the H-1B visa program had never been enacted, computer science job availability in the labor market would be up 11 percent and wages in the tech industry would have increased by five percent, Breitbart News reported.

Representatives of the Chinese government and the European Space Agency have been in talks regarding the construction of a possible moon base in the near future, it has been revealed.

Tian Yulong, the secretary general of China’s space agency, disclosed the talks on Chinese state media, which Pal Hvistendahl, a spokesman for the ESA, then later confirmed. “The Chinese have a very ambitious moon program already in place,” Hvistendahl said. “Space has changed since the space race of the ’60s. We recognise that to explore space for peaceful purposes, we do need international co-operation.”

Details of the project have been kept securely under wraps, but the director general of the ESA, Johann-Dietrich Wörner, fleshed out an idea for a moon village in an interview last year:

If I say Moon Village, it does not mean single houses, a church, a town hall and so on. No, that would be misleading. My idea only deals with the core of the concept of a village: people working and living together in the same place. And this place would be on the Moon. In the Moon Village we would like to combine the capabilities of different space-faring nations, with the help of robots and astronauts. The participants can work in different fields, perhaps they will conduct pure science and perhaps there will even be business ventures like mining or tourism. The Moon Village would also act as a ‘pit stop’ for the further exploration of the Universe. The ESA is eager to fly to Mars as well.

Last week, an unmanned spacecraft was launched on a mission to dock with China’s unoccupied space station, which is currently in orbit. The ESA hopes to have a European on board the station in another future collaboration.

China also plans to launch a mission to the dark side of the moon sometime next year, which would be the first of its kind in that region of the moon, collecting mineral samples for further analysis.

A Thai man filmed himself murdering his 11-month-old child on Facebook Live before committing suicide.

After reportedly being alerted to the livestream by friends of the man, police “rushed to an abandoned hotel near the international airport on Monday afternoon,” only to find both bodies hanged.

“They had already died when I arrived there,” said Lieutenant Jullaus Suvannin, who also claimed that “a smartphone was found propped up against a wall.”

The incident happened after an argument between the man and the child’s mother, according to police.

According to Reuters, the video was present on Facebook for 24 hours before removal.

“This is an appalling incident and our hearts go out to the family of the victim,” a Facebook spokesperson told Reuters. “There is absolutely no place for content of this kind on Facebook and it has now been removed.”

Violent Facebook live broadcasts of crimes taking place have proved a problem for Facebook, who have agreed that they need to improve their response.

On Easter Sunday, Facebook user Steve Stephens filmed himself shooting and killing 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. and evaded police for days before eventually committing suicide in a standoff.

Following the revelation that the video of the murder was on Facebook for hours before removal, the company admitted in a statement that they “need to do better.”

In January, four people also filmed themselves torturing and beating a tied up disabled boy, who was repeatedly forced to say, “f*ck Trump,” and, “f*ck white people.”

The number of active tuberculosis (TB) cases diagnosed in Minnesota increased 12 percent in 2016 to 168, up from 150 one year earlier, according to the Minnesota Department of Health’s (MDH) Tuberculosis Prevention and Control Program’s Quarterly Surveillance Report, October 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016.

Ninety percent of these 168 cases (152 of 168) were foreign-born, significantly higher than the national 2016 average of 67.9 percent of active TB cases that were foreign-born.

Fourteen of these 168 cases, or 9 percent were diagnosed within the first year in the United States of the 2,635 refugees who were resettled in Minnesota in FY 2016. The majority of these refugees came from two high TB burden countries: 1,195 came from Somalia, and 653 came from Burma, according to the State Department’s interactive website.

Eleven of these 14 cases of active TB in refugees were actually diagnosed in pre-immigration exams overseas before their arrival in Minnesota – a remarkable situation that would have either violated U.S. law or required the granting of a waiver by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office within the Department of Homeland Security, since active TB is a “Class A” health risk which is prohibited entry to the U.S. without such a waiver.

Three of these 14 cases of active TB in refugees were diagnosed during the refugee health exams conducted after their arrival in the United States.

Breitbart News asked USCIS to explain why these 11 refugees diagnosed with active TB during overseas medical examinations and classified as “Class A” health risks were allowed to enter the United States, but has not received a response.

“The [overseas] medical examination determines whether the applicant has an inadmissible condition of public health significance (a Class A condition) or has a health-related condition that is admissible but that might require extensive medical treatment or follow-up (a Class B condition). Applicants with Class A (inadmissible) conditions can only enter the United States if they are granted a waiver,” a 2013 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report noted:

Applicants who have Class A conditions include those who 1) have a communicable disease of public health significance, 2) do not have documentation of having received vaccinations against vaccine-preventable diseases, 3) have a physical or mental disorder with associated harmful behavior, or 4) abuse or are addicted to drugs. (42 USC 252, 8 USC 1182, and 8 USC 1222 provide for the physical and mental examination of applicants in accordance with regulations prescribed by the HHS Secretary.) The communicable diseases of public health significance include tuberculosis, syphilis, chancroid, gonorrhea, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum, Hansen disease (leprosy) . . . (emphasis added)

Eight of the 168 cases of active TB diagnosed in Minnesota during 2016 were of the extremely dangerous Multi-drug resistant (MDR) strain; that is they are resistant to two of the four drugs usually used to effectively treat active TB, INH and rifampin.

“The introduction of MDR TB to the United States represents a serious public health threat, since its successful treatment is uncertain and very expensive. Active TB can usually be treated successfully in six to nine months at a cost of $17,000 per patient, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), but MDR TB treatment costs more than $150,000 per patient and can take between 20 and 26 months,” as Breitbart News reported previously:

The six to nine month treatment regimen for active TB, which has been standard practice in the United States for some 50 years, involves a combination of four drugs: rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Over the past several decades, new strains of TB have developed around the world which are resistant to at least two of these four drugs, hence the term MDR TB. Treatment for MDR TB begins only after the patient is observed to be resistant to the standard four drug protocol. Subsequent to diagnosis, a number of expensive “second level” drugs are added to the patient’s treatment regimen.

In 2016, the eight cases of MDR TB diagnosed in Minnesota accounted for 1.9 percent of the 168 cases of active TB diagnosed in the state.

“In 2016, a total of 9,287 new tuberculosis (TB) cases were reported in the United States; this provisional* count represents the lowest number of U.S. TB cases on record and a 2.7% decrease from 2015,” the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported in March:

Minnesota was one of the few states where the number of active TB cases increased in 2016 , and one of only 12 states that reported “incidence higher than the national incidence.”

State-specific TB incidence in 2016 ranged from 0.2 cases per 100,000 persons in Wyoming to 8.3 in Hawaii (median state incidence = 1.9). Twelve states (Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, and Texas) and DC reported incidence higher than the national incidence. . . Among 9,287 TB cases reported in 2016, U.S.-born persons accounted for 2,935 (31.6%) cases, and 6,307 (67.9%) cases occurred among foreign-born persons; 45 (0.5%) cases occurred among persons whose national origin was not known (Table 2). TB incidence among U.S.-born persons (1.1 cases per 100,000) decreased 8.4% from 2015 (Figure). Incidence among foreign-born persons (14.6 cases per 100,000) decreased 3.2% from 2015, but was approximately 14 times the incidence among U.S.-born persons

The refugee community in Minnesota, and particularly the Somali refugee community, has been at the center of several recent public health issues in the state.

“During the five years between 2010 and 2014, 732 cases of active TB were diagnosed in Minnesota. Of these, 81 percent, or 593, were foreign-born. Of foreign-born cases, 50 percent, or 296, were refugees, according to ‘The Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Minnesota, 2010-2014,’ a report published by the Minnesota Department of Health,” Breitbart News reported previously.

“Twenty-nine percent of the 593 foreign-born cases of active TB diagnosed in Minnesota, or 161, were attributed to Somali born migrants. Almost all Somali migrants to the United States have arrived under the federal refugee resettlement program,” Breitbart News noted.

In April, 29 out of 34 cases of measles diagnosed in a record outbreak in Minnesota were identified within members of the state’s Somali community.

Also in April, two doctors and one other person were arrested in Michigan on charges of performing illegal female genital mutilation procedures on Somali girls transported from Minnesota.</td>

TEL AVIV – More than 30 Israeli families who lost relatives to terror attacks have signed a letter to FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, accusing the Palestine Football Association (PFA) and its president, Jibril Rajoub, with severe violations of its statutes, including incitement to terrorism.

The letter charges the PFA with breaching two provisions of FIFA’s Statutes and two of the association’s Disciplinary Code.

Included in those violations are Palestinian soccer competitions named after Palestinian terrorists, such as an annual contest named in honor of PLO founder Khalil al-Wazir who, according to Palestinian sources, was behind the deaths of more than 120 Israelis.

Rajoub himself, the letter says, has glorified violence and incited Palestinians, lauded recent terror attacks as “individual acts of bravery” and noted that “he is proud” of the perpetrators. He has also compared Israeli Jews to Satan. In February 2014 he called for the abduction of Israelis. Later that year three Israeli teenagers, Gilad Shaer, Naftali Frenkel and Eyal Yifrach, were kidnapped and murdered. Rajoub subsequently congratulated Hamas for carrying out the triple attack. He was quoted saying, “If we had a nuke, we’d have used it [against Israel] this very morning.”

The letter also said PFA’s boycott of Israel ran contradictory to FIFA’s commitment to using soccer as a “bridge to peace.” Rajoub has called for the expulsion of the Israel Football Association (IFA) and may use an upcoming FIFA summit in Bahrain to promote the idea again.

“We are aware that the Palestinian demand to expel the Israeli Football Association may be raised at the FIFA Council and Congress, respectively on 9 and 11 May,” said Shimon Samuels, the European representative of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC). “We call, on the contrary, for the Palestinian Football Association to be expelled until all names of terrorists are removed from Palestinian teams, tournaments and stadiums.”

Ronald Lauder — president of the World Jewish Congress (WJC) — wrote to FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Thursday, telling him, “The campaign of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA) to sanction Israel has no place on the FIFA Congress agenda.”

Rajoub himself is a former terrorist who spent 15 years in Israeli jails before being released in a 1985 prisoner swap. He has served in several senior positions in the PA, including chief of its secret police.

Among the bereaved family members who signed the letter to FIFA were Brenda and Nachum Lemkus, whose daughter Dalia was slain in November 2014, and Doron Mizrahi, father of Ziv Mizrachi, who was murdered in November 2015.

Brenda Lemkus said: “Our darling daughter Dalia was murdered as a result of the constant incitement of the Palestinians and their glorification of terrorists. When we heard that the incitement and glorification of terrorists was so widespread in Palestinian football, we didn’t think twice about joining the campaign and signing a complaint.”

Itamar Marcus, the director of Israeli monitoring group Palestinian Media Watch, which was in charge of gathering evidence against the PFA and Rajoub, said that if FIFA neglected to address the letter, “it will be a disgrace for all the member associations and a permanent stain of FIFA’s reputation.”

Last month, Rajoub received a court summons and compensation lawsuit for $250 million upon landing at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York over his alleged involvement in the killing of an American-Palestinian citizen in 1995.

Azam Rahim’s family, who live in the state of Texas, served the court summons on Tuesday. According to the charge sheet, on September 29, 1995 Rahim was arrested by Preventive Security officials and taken to a security facility where he was tortured to death.</td>

Organizers of the now-scrapped Fyre Festival — a promised “luxury” music festival in the Bahamas that left guests who paid tens of thousands of dollars scrambling immediately to find flights home — have been hit with a $100 million lawsuit alleging the whole enterprise was a “get-rich-quick scam” from the beginning.

Attorney Mark Geragos filed the $100 million proposed class-action lawsuit in California Sunday on behalf of client and festival attendee Daniel Jung, Billboard reports.

The claim alleges that Fyre organizers — namely, the rapper Ja Rule and 25-year-old entrepreneur Billy McFarland — attempted to “fleece attendees for hundreds of millions of dollars by inducing them to fly to a remote island without food, shelter or water—and without regard to what might happen to them after that.”

Ticket buyers — some of whom spent up to a reported $200,000 on the most luxurious festival accommodations — arrived at the Island of Exumas on Thursday to find a festival site in disarray, with unfinished infrastructure and stages, disaster relief tents in place of luxury villas, and “gourmet” bread and cheese sandwiches in a cafeteria organizers had promised would be staffed by a celebrity chef.

The festival — which had been heavily promoted for months by models and influential social media personalities including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Hailey Baldwin —had been billed as a unique “cultural experience,” with planned performances from Blink-182 and the rappers Tyga and Desiigner, and opulent ticket packages offering the ability to charter a yacht. The festival’s official video advertisement promised the island was once owned by legendary drug kingpin Pablo Escobar.

But guests who made it to the island reported seeing wet, soggy tents, a lack of security and food, and even stray animals roaming the campgrounds.

After organizers cancelled the event Friday, attendees struggled to schedule return flights home as the Island of Exumas’ tiny airport was overrun with last-minute travelers.

In the lawsuit, Geragos alleges that the festival was “more like The Hunger Games or Lord of the Flies than Coachella,” according to Billboard. The suit alleges fraud, breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, with Geragos charging that the island was not “private,” as had been advertised, and had never been owned by Escobar.

The lawsuit also claims that Rule and McFarland knew the festival would be a catastrophe and warned A-list promoters not to attend.

“They called all the A-list names and the modeling agencies and told them not to come,” a source told the New York Post‘s Page Six over the weekend. “They were just like, ‘Oh, come next weekend when all the kinks have been worked out.’ This was before the chaos even started.”

Organizers issued a statement to Billboard claiming “full responsibility” for the festival, but promised full refunds and VIP accommodations to next year’s event, which they said would take place at a “United States beach venue.”

“We apologize for any inconvenience the past 24-hours has caused and we look forward to making a considerable donation to the Bahamas Red Cross Society as part of our initiatives,” the organizers wrote. “We need to make this right. And once we make this right, then we will put on the dream festival we sought to have since the inception of Fyre.”

<td class='normal' valign='top'>. @Jim_Jordan of Freedom Caucus on spending deal: You are going to see a lot of conservatives be against this plan https://t.co/nhfhOBvgnQ

SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER

Monday on CNN’s “New Day,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the vice chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said that he foresees some conservatives coming out against a proposed government spending bill set to come out later this week.

“I mean, look, money goes to Planned Parenthood as you said,” Jordan said to host Chris Cuomo. “Money continues to go to sanctuary cities but no money for the border wall. I think you’re going to see a lot of conservatives be against this plan this week.”

Jordan argued the entire point of doing a short-term spending bill last year was to get the government through until the next administration took office. Then, he said, Republican in a GOP-controlled federal government would have the opportunity to fight for their priorities.

“Why did we last fall do a short-term spending bill if we weren’t going to actually fight for the things we told the voters we were going to fight for?” he said. “So we’d have been, I mean if this is the deal we’re going to get it seems to me we should have just did the bill for the whole year. But we specifically held the vote for; we did a short-term spending bill for this time so that when Republicans controlled the government, we could actually do the things we campaigned on. This bill doesn’t seem to do that. Plus it maintains Chris this idea that for every new dollar you spend in defense money you’ve got to give the Democrats more money in non-defense. That’s again not what we campaigned on. So I’m disappointed. We’ll see how it plays out this week. But I think you’re going to see conservatives have some real concerns with this legislation.

A new poll sponsored by the University of Virginia Center for Politics finds that an overwhelming number of Trump voters agree with his statement that the press is the enemy of the American people.

The Center for Politics, founded by UVA’s Robert Kent Gooch Professor of Politics, Larry Sabato, recently sponsored a poll by Glen Bolger’s Public Opinion Strategies conducted between April 17 and 19 of 1,000 voters who admitted to voting for Trump in last year’s election.

The poll featured a long list of questions for participants. The president’s supporters have what the survey called a “jaundiced eye on the media.”

Participants were asked, “When you hear the media being critical of Donald Trump, does their criticism make you question your support for him, or does it reinforce that he’s on the right track in terms of shaking things up in Washington, D.C.?”

A whopping 88 percent said that the media’s attacks on Trump actually reinforce their feeling that he is on the right track. In contrast, a mere 12 percent said that the media’s criticism makes them question their support for the president.

One female Trump supporter told the pollsters that the media is not being a “voice of the people,” while a male voter who said he also voted for Obama in the past said that the media spends too much time “blowing things out of proportion.”

Another female Trump voter who also claimed she voted for Obama told the poll takers that she thinks the media is “creating a lot of the racism that’s out there.”

Meanwhile, the poll also found that a huge number of Trump voters either strongly or somewhat agree that the media is the enemy.

When the pollsters asked, “Do you agree or disagree with Donald Trump’s statement that the press ‘is the enemy of the American people,'” another 88 percent said that they agree with Trump.

The 88 percent was closely split, with 42 percent saying they “strongly agree” with Trump’s heavily used stump speech claim, while 45 percent said they “somewhat agree” with the statement.

Only nine percent said they “somewhat disagree,” while a tiny four percent said they “strongly disagree” with Trump’s accusation, for a total of only 12 percent.

The survey was taken of Trump voters across the nation and also among participants of focus groups held in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Texas. It has a margin of error of plus 3.1 percent.

Reality TV star Chris Soules, who formerly served as a contestant on ABC’s dating show The Bachelor, was reportedly arrested in Iowa on Monday after allegedly fleeing the scene of a fatal accident.

Soules, who starred in the show’s 19th season, is currently in custody in Iowa’s Buchanan County Jail, after reportedly driving into a tractor trailer on Monday evening, according to TMZ.

The crash sent the tractor into a ditch; the driver was taken to a hospital and later died. Soules was reportedly apprehended by authorities after witnesses to the crash identified him and contacted the police.

Soules, 35, was also taken to a hospital for medical attention but did not sustain serious injuries.

TMZ claims to have obtained documents in which police confirm the reality star was in possession of alcoholic beverage containers at the time of the crash.

Soules was reportedly placed in custody at the Buchanan County Jail and was set to be arraigned Tuesday morning.

He is reportedly being held on a $10,000 bond.

House GOP leadership told members of the House of Representatives on Wednesday evening that the House will vote on a revised version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) on Thursday.

The announcement comes after a tumultuous process for the bill, which has seen previously scheduled votes pulled after Speaker Paul Ryan failed to accumulate enough Republican support on prior attempts to pass the bill.

House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) stepped up and helped negotiate, with Tuesday Group co-chairman Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-NJ), a revised version of the bill–dubbed the MacArthur amendment–that revived the effort and collected presumably enough Republican votes to pass the bill.

Meadows’ efforts in no small part seem to have succeeded where Ryan failed, rallying his House Republican colleagues behind a years-long campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare–despite the fact this bill doesn’t constitute a full repeal of the previous president’s signature law.

Vice President Mike Pence, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, and others have worked alongside congressional Republicans, especially Meadows–who has emerged as a force in the negotiating process so strong some have begun calling him the acting speaker of the House in the wake of Ryan’s failures–to bring the new bill to the brink of passage.

Vice President Mike Pence visited the Capitol building Wednesday afternoon to reassure lawmakers about the Obamacare repeal bill.

Meadows, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, commended the actions of President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Congressman Tom MacArthur for bringing the Obamacare repeal package this close to passage. He said:

Not only have we made good progress, we have to get give a good shout out to Tom MacArthur and the President and the Vice President for their efforts in the last couple of weeks. It would be a mistake to suggest that had Tom MacArthur, the President, and the Vice President have not gotten involved in this process, then we would not have the options now for everyone to consider. Tom has worked closely hard with Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden and the committee to make sure that what we do is keeping in line with repealing and replacing Obamacare and drives down premiums and keeps pre-existing conditions.

Meadows told Breitbart News, “I fully expect that we will repeal most aspects of Obamacare by the end of May. It may have been a deterrent in the first 100 days, but by the end of the first 120 days or so it will be seen as a significant accomplishment. It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish, as the song used to say. We will have an excellent finish.”</td>

There are more than 200 members of the violent, El Salvadorian MS-13 gang in the Long Island, New York area, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The FBI’s Long Island Gang Task Force Director Geraldine Hart told NBC New York in an interview that members of MS-13 “bolster their ranking among other gangs by using violence.”

Hart told the media that the MS-13 gang problem, specifically as its members are usually illegal immigrants, is a national issue across the U.S.

“This is not a local problem,” Hart told NBC New York. “This is a national and international problem. We know that there are direct links from El Salvador up here into the New York area.”

The area of Brentwood, Long Island, more precisely, has undergone a transformation due to the MS-13 gang and its roots in illegal immigration.

As the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) notes, MS-13 flourished in Brentwood as placement of unaccompanied minor illegal immigrant children grew more than 100 percent from 2015 to 2016.

Brentwood has seen a booming El Salvadorian population in an area that was once primarily working class, Puerto Rican-Americans.

“By 2010, nearly 40 percent of the community was born in or had citizenship from a Central American country,” CIS Fellow Joseph Kolb writes. “This figure was nearly six times the national average. The majority 68 percent Hispanic population shifted now to 51 percent Central American and 18 percent Puerto Rican.”

Recent Long Island-area deaths by MS-13 include the brutal murders of Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas, two teenage girls beaten and killed by illegal immigrant gang members, Breitbart Texas reported.

Other recent murder victims of MS-13 include teenagers Michael Lopez Banegas, Jefferson Villalobos, Jorge Tigre and Justin Llivicura, all of whom were beaten to death in Long Island’s Recreation Village Town Park, Breitbart Texas reported.

Google has launched a new series of workshops which aim to teach teenagers how to tackle “fake news” and “hate speech.”

“Internet Citizens” will be run by Google’s YouTube in cities across the United Kingdom for those between the ages of 13 and 18. The workshops “are intended to raise awareness around issues such as tolerance, empathy and abuse online,” according to The Guardian.

“Nearly all of us will have come across comments or content online that shocked or even offended us, sometimes leaving us feeling isolated or powerless to change the conversation,” said YouTube’s head of public policy, Naomi Gummer. “And for young people in particular, this sense of vulnerability can be heightened if it’s difficult to judge whether a piece of content is real, especially when something is shared on social media by a trusted friend. That’s why we’re launching Internet Citizens.”

“This is just one part of our commitment to a better web… Alongside this, we are exploring more innovative ways to use technology; to partner with experts to help us tackle hate speech online and we are taking a hard look at our policies around offensive content,” she continued, adding, “We’ll share more updates on these areas in the coming weeks.”

UK Youth, a charity who helped develop the workshops with YouTube, claimed that through the initiative they want to help “make the internet a positive place” and empower young people to “express themselves.”

“Young people in the UK spend more time online than ever before. In this complex world, there is an urgent need to help young people embrace the positive aspects of connectivity, but we must also support them to manage the negative effects,” proclaimed UK Youth’s chief executive, Anna Smee. “Through Internet Citizens, UK Youth is empowering young people to express themselves, have a voice, listen to others and ultimately gain a sense of belonging by discovering the skills needed to act safely and responsibly online, and make the internet a positive place.”

In March, Google pledged to crack down on “offensive” and “extremist” content on the platform, after hundreds of large advertisers withdrew from the site.

Companies such as AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, The BBC, The Guardian, Channel 4, Toyota, McDonald’s, and even the British Government all withdrew adverts from Google-owned sites, claiming to be “deeply concerned” about their adverts appearing alongside content on YouTube promoting “hate.”

Google also took heat from the UK Home Affairs Select Committee last month, who claimed the company was being too “soft” on “hate speech.”

Two foreign nationals have pleaded guilty after smuggling a teenage girl across the U.S.-Mexico Border to Houston, Texas.

The two foreign nationals, Daniel Lopez-Martinez, 32, of Mexico; Juan Tomas Nicolas, 23, of Guatemala; along with 29-year-old Mission, Texas, resident Ernesto Solis admitted to smuggling an illegal immigrant 17-year-old girl from El Salvador.

The three men smuggled the minor across the southern border for a fee, arriving in Houston and immediately making phone calls to the girls’ father, demanding more money than originally agreed.

Lopez-Martinez, Nicolas, and Solis demanded the illegal immigrants’ father for an additional $4,700 in order for his daughter to be handed over to him after the smuggling effort.

During the meeting place where the three men were planning to hand over the girl to her father in exchange for the money, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents stepped in to arrest the smugglers and rescue the minor.

The three men are facing a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. It is unclear whether the two foreign nationals will be deported from the U.S. following their release.

The ‘Angry Police Wives’ group has staged a protest on the eve of the French presidential elections, after several police officers were injured and one killed by an Islamist armed with a Kalashnikov rifle.

Over a hundred wives, husbands and other partners of serving police officers marched in Paris to protest what they see as a failure on the part of the Socialist Party government to protect officers like the ones targeted in the deadly shooting on April 20th.

Thirty-seven-year-old Xavier Jugelé was murdered by Karim Cheurfi, a career criminal living with his Algerian mother, who and had been previously imprisoned for attempting to murder another police officer. He had handwritten notes defending the Islamic State terror group and a copy of the Qu’ran with him, according to reports.

The 'Angry Police Wives' put their feet down in Paris protest https://t.co/E7dJbsZOAW — FemmesSécuritéPaix (@SecurityPaix) April 22, 2017

The authorities have revealed that he should have been recalled to prison prior to his deadly attack, after breaking his parole to travel to Algeria.

“The Meaux prosecutor’s office [legal authority] demanded that he be recalled to jail to complete his sentence,” admitted Francois Molins, France’s most senior investigating magistrate.

“[But] On the 7th April Karim Cheurfi was brought before a young magistrate who reminded him of his [prison release] obligations without ordering him to complete the rest of his prison sentence.”

In an interview with Sky News diplomatic editor Dominic Waghorn, one wife said she wanted the government to “protect her husband”.

She said she was “angry because [officers] are not protected and it’s not [right] that they are killed like that. We want protection for them. For all forces. Gendarmes, firemen, policemen.”

Asked if she thought the Champs-Élysées killing would have an effect on the presidential elections, she said, “Yes. We want more security.”

Security has been a key theme of Front National leader Marine Le Pen’s campaign. Minutes before news of the attack broke she was saying that it was “a major subject that nobody has mentioned.”

She added: “We must take control of our national borders to know who is coming in. We must reorganise the intelligence services, reinforce the means at the disposal of police and gendarmes, and attack the evil at its roots – that’s to say the communitarianism and the development of Islamic fundamentalism.”

Her main rival for the presidency, the former Socialist economy minister and Rothschild banker Emmanuel Macron, has struck a more passive tone, describing radical Islamic terrorism as an “imponderable problem” which will be “part of our daily lives for the years to come”.</td>

Fox Sports 1’s Katie Nolan is either trying to force Fox to fire her or is just disturbingly passionate about issues involving Sean Hannity and national surveillance.

The host of Garbage Time, which used to air Wednesday nights on FS1 but no longer does as Fox continues to mull Nolan’s future, took extreme umbrage with a tweet from Sean Hannity over the weekend.

Hannity’s tweet , directed at the New York Times, took exception to a story which referred to him as a regular Trump adviser. Hannity, claiming he had not spoken to the Times, wondered whether or not he had been surveilled:

@nytimes Any conversation I have with ANYONE is supposed to be PRIVATE. I have NEVER talked to you. Was I surveilled and unmasked by u/NSA? — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017

Nolan fired back:

@seanhannity @nytimes To say your convos are private, sure. But to suggest if something leaked that you were SURVEILLED? That’s next-level self-importance — Katie Nolan (@katienolan) April 22, 2017

Clearly, Nolan remains unaware of the saga of fellow-Fox employee James Rosen, who was secretly declared a criminal co-conspirator and a flight risk by the Obama Justice Department, resulting in a judge giving the Justice Department the ability to read through all of his gmails.

Of course, this writer has no actual knowledge of whether Hannity was surveilled. However, if a Fox News reporter can have his emails read by prying government eyes, why couldn’t a much-higher profile Sean Hannity?

Nolan’s frontal assault led to a backlash on Twitter from Hannity followers and other right-leaning users.

According to the sports media site Awful Announcing, after someone brought up the dangers of Nolan’s criticizing another Fox employee, Nolan posted, and then deleted, this tweet:

Nolan’s behavior towards Hannity is highly unusual for someone whose status remains in limbo, the way hers does. FS1 did not renew Nolan’s show in its current format. Though Fox still has Nolan under contract and has said they intend to keep her on, no one really knows what the future holds for her there.

Rumors that ESPN might have interest in Nolan when her contract ends next year have surfaced as well. Could that mean she’s rocking the boat at FS1 on purpose to force their hand and grab some liberal street cred by attacking a well-known conservative, before joining the ranks of the uber-leftist ESPN?

Of course, it’s always possible that Nolan just had way too much time on her hands on a Saturday night and felt like shaking things up a bit–though, it’s questionable that she would have chosen a high-profile personality employed by her parent company as the target of her disdain if she was just looking to start a fight.

While Nolan may not report to the same people Hannity does, their checks have the same return-to-sender address: 21st Century Fox. If Nolan had designs on remaining at FS1 long term, there are a lot better ways of ensuring that other than engaging in profanity-laced Twitter rants against founding members of one of the network’s most profitable divisions.

Or, again, she could just be bored.

President Donald Trump is promising “unwavering support” for the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

The president said in a statement Sunday:

The statement that accompanied my signing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, sets forth my intention to spend the funds it appropriates, including the funds for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), consistently with my responsibilities under the Constitution. It does not affect my unwavering support for HBCUs and their critical educational missions. In February of this year, I signed an Executive Order pledging to strengthen the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality education; to ensure equitable opportunities for HBCUs to participate in Federal programs; and to increase the number of college-educated Americans who feel empowered and able to advance the common good at home and abroad. My commitment to the above-stated goals remains unchanged.

In an earlier statement on Friday, Trump said that provisions that distribute funds on the basis of race, with an example being the HCBU program, would be treated “in a manner consistent with the requirement to afford equal protection of the laws under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.”

According to Politico, Trump’s earlier statement “raised questions about whether Trump would implement” the 25-year-old HBCU program because it questioned whether the Constitution allows a federal financing program based on race.

Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.), ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, and Cedric Richmond (D-La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Trump’s statement was “misinformed factually,” and called the president’s statement “stunningly careless and divisive.”

In his statement released on Sunday, Trump also noted that U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would deliver the commencement address at Bethune-Cookman University on Wednesday.

“Secretary DeVos chose an HBCU as the venue for her first commencement address to demonstrate my Administration’s dedication to these great institutions of higher learning,” the president said. “I look forward to selecting an Executive Director and Board for my HBCU initiative and continuing this important work with HBCUs throughout the nation.”

Last week the Florida chapter of the NAACP called upon DeVos to decline the invitation to give the commencement address at B-CU, “based on her horrible public education record impacting blacks and minorities in Florida and around the country.”

Adora Obi Nweze, president of NAACP Florida State Conference and member of the national board of directors, said:

The role of the U.S. Department of Education is to prohibit discrimination ensuring equal access to public education and the new Secretary of Education should pledge to drastically increase funding for all historically black colleges and universities. This has not happened to-date. If Secretary DeVos ultimately speaks at commencement and receives an honorary degree, this would be a slap in the face to minorities, women and all communities of color.

The NAACP also condemned Dr. Edison O. Jackson, president of B-CU, for extending the invitation to DeVos:

We believe the leadership of Bethune Cookman University should not bestow an honorary degree to Secretary DeVos based on her post-secondary education record. What makes the Bethune Cookman University approach unusual, is their plan to honor a person who has been on the job less than one hundred days and has no record of advancing educational equity for all students.

In an open letter published at the Orlando Sentinel, however, Jackson observed that “dialogue is a two-way street,” and noted that some college presidents “have rescinded invitations to potentially controversial speakers.”

He continued:

That is not my intention with DeVos. I am of the belief that it does not benefit our students to suppress voices that we disagree with, or to limit students to only those perspectives that are broadly sanctioned by a specific community. One of the lasting hallmarks of higher education is its willingness to engage, explore and experience that which we deem as “other.” When we shelter our students and campus communities from views that are diametrically opposed to their own, we actually leave our students far less capable of combating those ideas.

“I have gratitude for the past, and hope for the future,” Jackson said. “So I ask the courtesy of your consideration to hear what Betsy DeVos, the 11th U.S. secretary of education, tells us.”

Essence reported comments Monday from two of B-CU’s graduating seniors – identical twins – who have been protesting DeVos’s anticipated address.

Taylor and Tyler Durrant say Jackson’s choice of DeVos is both “insulting” and “embarrassing.” They reportedly expressed doubt about DeVos’s support for those coming from low-income families, in light of the secretary’s recent withdrawal of protections put in place by the Obama administration for students who have mismanaged or are defaulting on their student loans.

“The U.S. Secretary of Education is someone who has never known what it is like to have financial aid. … she is someone who has been rich all her life,” Taylor Durrant told Essence. “She doesn’t know what going through the public education system means and what it can do to a student.”

“I think it’s just a slap in the face to understand now that we’re being sold … our legacy is being sold,” said Tyler Durrant.

DeVos herself released her own statement on Sunday, emphasizing that she is “a strong supporter of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and the critical role they play in communities and in our higher education system.”

“I am happy to see the president reaffirmed this Administration’s support for HCBUs,” she continued. “I will continue to be an advocate for them and for programs that make higher education more accessible to all students.”

DeVos added she is looking forward “to visiting with the students, faculty and administration of Bethune-Cookman University this week and delivering the 2017 commencement address, my first as Secretary.”</td>

Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) has confessed it is dealing with a “four-digit number” of migrants with declared links to the Taliban, potentially endangering neighbouring countries such as France.

According to a Der Spiegel report, German federal prosecutors are currently investigating at least 70 Afghans, although is unclear whether they are all suspected of links to the Islamist group.

Six have actually been detained, and cases are pending against several more – with prosecutor-general Peter Frank warning politicians that the authorities, which are also contending with suspected Islamic State sympathisers, have now reached “the limits of their capacity”.

Europe has been plagued by a number of mass-casualty terror attacks perpetrated by migrants in recent years. Recent examples include Uzbek asylum seeker Rakhmat Akilov, who drove a hijacked lorry into civilians on a pedestrianised street in Stockholm, and Anis Amri, a Tunisian asylum seeker who carried out a similar attack against a Christmas market in Berlin.

The revelations concerning Taliban fighters in Germany could, therefore, have an impact on the presidential run-off in neighbouring France: anti-mass migration populist Marine Le Pen is facing off against former Rothschild banker and Socialist economy minister Emmanuel Macron, and the issue of border control has been hotly contested.

Ms Le Pen has pledged to quit Schengen, the European Union agreement which eliminates border controls between most EU member-states, very early on in her presidency.

Radical Islamists have previously taken advantage of Schengen, which has been denounced as “an international passport-free zone for terrorists” by former Interpol chief Robert Noble, to attack France, often from extremist enclaves in neighbouring Belgium.

By preventing us from having national borders, the European Union condemns us to undergo #mass immigration #Marine2017 https://t.co/DxnMk2ikJH — Marine in English (@Marine2017_EN) March 10, 2017

Macron, on the other hand, is deeply committed to the EU, saying that France was a “valley of tears” before the bloc. He also accepts mass immigration will be a fact of life moving forward:

“We have entered a world of great migrations,” he said in February 2017, “and we will have more and more of it.”

Macron is also relatively laid back with respect to terrorism, describing it as “an imponderable problem”, which will be “part of our daily lives for years to come”.

Similar comments after the Nice lorry attack on Bastille Day 2016 by Macron’s former colleague, ex-prime minister Manuel Valls, proved extremely unpopular with the French public, who loudly heckled him at a crowded memorial event.

“Times have changed and we should learn to live with terrorism,” Valls had said following the attack, which killed 86.

The backlash against this remark is thought to have played a prominent role in terminating his own hopes of a presidential run.</td>

Gov. Jerry Brown is coming under increasing fire from all sides for ‘stealing’ $1.2 Billion of the cigarette tax money—raised from Proposition 56—and diverting it into the state’s General Fund.

Both Republican and Democrat representatives from California’s Congressional Delegation spoke out this week against Brown’s proposed budget—in hopes of convincing him to reverse the diversion of funds in the looming budget fight known to insiders as the “May Revise”.

This past Tuesday, Congressmen Raul Ruiz (D-Palm Desert)—who is a physician that represents the Palm Springs area—sent California’s Democrat governor a letter critical of Brown’s plan.

According to a local Palm Springs CBS affiliate (CBS 2), [t]he letter calls for money from the voter-approved Proposition 56 tobacco tax increase to be used for medical education programs, payments for health care services and treatment for Medi-Cal patients.”

Reportedly it is signed by 37 of the 53 California representatives, but multiple requests by Breitbart News for a comment or a copy of the congressman’s letter itself went unanswered.

“We are concerned that your FY 2017-2018 state budget redirects Prop 56 revenues away from Graduate Medical Education programs intended to address California’s physician shortages, as well as Medicaid payment increases intended to improve access to care for Medi-Cal patients,” the letter reportedly read, according to the CBS 2 story.

On Thursday, Republican Congressmen David Valadao (R-Hanford) and Jeff Denham (R-Turlock)—both from the Central Valley hard hit by the drought where a significant majority are dependent on MediCal— jointly released the following statement:

“At the cost of families in rural California, Governor Brown has prioritized access to healthcare for those living in urban areas and along the coast over those most in need in the Central Valley. If he truly cared about ensuring all Californians had access to healthcare, he would work to improve Medicaid reimbursement rates for the most prosperous state in the nation. Governor Brown worsened the problem when he went against the wish of California voters and stole the $1.2 billion from prop 56.”

The link provided in the joint press release—leads to a story on the California Medical Association (CMA) website entitled: “Brown’s budget steals Prop. 56 revenue,” which excoriates Brown.

A quick review of the fine print in the official language of Proposition 56 reveals that Jerry Brown is pulling a fast one. While the funding formula that allows Prop 56 money to be diverted to the General Fund is rather complex, it must first be authorized by the “Board” of the newly created trust fund dubbed the “California Healthcare, Research and Prevention Tobacco Tax Act of 2016 Fund”—and that cannot happen until the tax is at least a year old. So, Jerry Brown is up to his same old tricks, playing smoke and mirrors with funds he has no control over.

There is a very limited pathway by which some funds may be transferred directly to the state’s General Fund—and it’s only in order to backfill a shortfall in tobacco taxes based on the falloff in cigarette sales due to the new, higher cigarette tax. In that case, funds can be used to make up for lost revenue to the state and “affected local governments.” Other than that, the money is rather tightly prescribed to replace funding shortfalls for breast cancer research and children’s health.

82% of remaining funds must be transferred to the newly-minted, “Healthcare Treatment Fund”—and from there to all the usual government programs including MediCal, unnamed “access to healthcare” programs and “geographical shortages of services” (which might be what Rep Ruiz dubs the “physician shortage”)

13% of remaining funds must be used for “the purpose of funding comprehensive tobacco prevention and control programs”

5% for overhead (unspecified)

The 82% portion will most likely be devoured by the perpetual MediCal shortfall, but it’s the 13% that is then divvied into so many different pies, it’s hard to know if it will make much of a difference. All of the grants have some loose affiliation with research or prevention of tobacco-related maladies:

15% to Department of Education for prevention programs

5% to the UC system for medical research

$30 Million to State Dept of Public Health (DPH) for dental disease prevention

$48 Million to law-enforcement agencies to crack down on cigarette smuggling, which is sure to increase

$30 Million to California Dept. of Justice (CA DOJ) to enforce laws related to illegal sales or smuggling of cigarettes

Another $6 Million to DPH for joint use with L/E for existing kids program known as Stop Tobacco Access to Kids Enforcement (STAKE) Act

$6 Million to Attorney General for cost of increased enforcement actions/prosecutions

Contrary to the assertions by the powerful medical lobby, CMA, who co-sponsored Prop 56, and who consider Brown’s raid on the revenue to be a betrayal of the intent of the measure, the devil’s always in the details.

When CMA President Ruth E. Haskins, M.D says,“The language of Prop. 56 was clear – the people voted overwhelmingly in support of improving payments for programs and providers to ensure that patients can see a doctor when and where they need one,” she may be right.

But she may be guilty of believing the slick sales pitches that her own organization put out promoting Prop 56, because nowhere in the fine print is there any sort of guarantee of higher reimbursement rates—there’s only vague language about addressing “geographical shortages” and “access to care”—and increasing funding to existing health and welfare programs like MediCal.

It has been said that “money is the mother’s milk of politics”—and there’s nothing like a virgin slush fund to draw out the jackals disguised as suitors. If Brown raids the kitty, who will try to stop him? State Controller Betty Yee hardly seems the type to take on the popular, scrappy governor, but who knows? Between the cigarette and the “pot” money, one thing’s sure:

There will be no shortage of political posturing and hot air in the 2018 election cycle.

The Mexican foreign secretary called the plan to build walls along the border a “hostile” and “deeply unfriendly” act, and an “aggravating action”. He warned that Mexico intends to conduct a fierce legal battle to stop any border walls that violate the rights of Mexicans.

Mexico Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray said building any walls when there are already 600 kilometers of barriers is not only a hostile and deeply unfriendly act, but one that “also is not going to fulfill the objectives that it raises, is not only an aggravating action, but it seems to be frankly a bad idea.”

The foreign secretary said Mexico is planning a legal fight, and it has no intention to pay for any border walls or to cooperate with the U.S. in any way on the development of border walls.

“Of course, any kind of financial cooperation or any other way in building the physical barrier between our nations and, of course, an important fundamental limit is not accepting the violation of the human rights of Mexicans in the United States.”

Videgaray charged that any border wall “is not part of a bilateral discussion and should not be, Mexicans should not be part of that discussion, we will not collaborate in any way the construction of something that hurts us, Is apparently an absolute waste of resources.”

Videgaray made this vow during his appearance before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Chamber of Deputies in Mexico City this week.

The foreign secretary said that his country had put together “a very significant amount of human resources” to argue that the U.S. is violating international treaties, “starting with the ominous Treaty of Guadalupe in 1948.” This was most likely a reference to the 1848 treaty that ended the Mexican-American war and set the Rio Grande as a boundary to Mexico.

He forewarns that Mexico will file lawsuits in the U.S., as well as in international courts of law if there are any violations of a border treaty, environmental treaties, or an international law regulation.

Secretary Videgaray told the Committee on Foreign Relations that Mexico “has been a tireless promoter of openness to the world, to open up to us,” for decades. He urged, “we must recognize that we face new circumstances, some of them unpublished and others that are reminiscent of things that happened to the world decades ago.”

“Today in the world there are threats to our paradigms of international coexistence that have been in force for decades. It is undeniable that there are outbreaks of isolationist protectionism, outbursts of nationalism that try to close the world and beyond that, from political actors of very diverse origins in different latitudes, question the principle of global integration.” In the same speech, he said, “first and foremost as it should be,” the United States must recognize Mexico as a sovereign nation.

The Mexican foreign secretary threatened that any attempt to tax remittances from the U.S. would be “a break point in any dialogue on other issues.” He called the “flow of foreign exchange” “a fundamental support for many families.” “[F]or Mexico, [it] is a non-negotiable issue,” he charged.

In his address, Videgaray also vowed that Mexico would “increase significantly the attention to Mexicans abroad.” Videgaray explained that the 50 Mexican consulates have assisted and protected 45,290 this year – “more than half were in the immigration field.”

There have been 2,400 migrants who have been provided legal representation, and they are representing those who have already been deported.

The foreign secretary said Mexico would never accept a unilateral decision by the United States to send migrants from other countries to Mexico, and the country is waiting to challenge executive orders “regarding the extension of the criteria to allow express deportation.” They are “waiting for the first act of implementation, not only the Mexican government but the allied organizations, non-governmental organizations, so that when the first act of application exists, proceed to challenge the general rule,” he said. “There is not yet an act of application regarding the criterion of expeditiously deporting someone who has more than 14 days in the country or someone who is beyond 100 kilometers of internment.”

The foreign secretary added that any revision to NAFTA must include a dialogue between Mexico, Canada, and the U.S.

Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, has addressed a letter to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo expressing his “shock and horror” that leftist sharia advocate and alleged terrorist supporter Linda Sarsour was tapped by CUNY’s Graduate School of Public Health & Public Policy as their commencement speaker, urging him to cancel her appearance at the taxpayer-funded university.

“Sarsour is a bigot and a divider,” Klein wrote. “It disgraces the state and city of New York for a taxpayer-funded university to confer this honor on her.” He noted that “CUNY of all places should not be elevating and honoring Linda Sarsour, given the recent appalling revelations of anti-Semitism on several CUNY campuses,” and he pointed out that “Sarsour’s values conflict with American values.”

Barbara Aaron, chief of staff to CUNY Graduate School of Public Health dean Ayman El-Mohandes, told The Daily Caller, “I am delighted to confirm that Linda Sarsour will indeed speak at our June 1 commencement at the Apollo Theater.”

In his letter, Klein went on to list several reasons that should disqualify Sarsour from delivering the keynote speak at CUNY. He explained:

Sarsour openly supports the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. She also opposes the right of the Jewish State of Israel to exist, expressing her unbridled hatred on Twitter with statements such as “Nothing is creepier than Zionism” and “[Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu is a waste of a human being.”

Nothing is creepier than Zionism.Challenge racism, #NormalizeJustice. Check out this video by @remroum http://t.co/q282BYT8 — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) October 31, 2012

Netanyahu is a waste of a human being. — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) October 22, 2015

Furthermore, Klein points out that Sarsour praises the act of young Arab children throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers as “the definition of courage.”

New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind (D-Brooklyn) similarly chastised Sarsour in a video message last week, asking her to explain her support for terrorism. “You think this is a courageous act; to pick up rocks and throw them at cars?” Hikind posited.

In 2013, a two-year-old girl went into a coma after Palestinians pelted the car she was in with rocks, forcing the car to crash. Adele Biton was in a coma for two years before succumbing to her injuries and developing pneumonia. She died when she was four.

Klein noted that, after receiving “justifiable backlash from New York City Council Member Rory Lancman and others, Sarsour tweeted, ‘The Zionist trolls are out to play. Bring it.’ Sarsour also tweeted her support for the intifada – the term for the Palestinian Arab terror war against Jews in Israel – describing it as ‘invaluable on many fronts,'” Klein wrote.

.@intifada has brought us some of the most important coverage and Palestine related news. They are invaluable on many fronts. — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) October 30, 2016

Klein also reminded Cuomo that Sarsour said she was “honored and privileged” to share a stage with convicted Palestinian terrorist Rasmea Odeh, who will soon be deported from the United States for allegedly committing immigration fraud and falsifying papers when entering America after she was freed during a prisoner-swap.

In an interview with The Nation, Sarsour suggested feminism and Zionism are incompatible, which quickly drew criticism from women who consider themselves both feminists and Zionists.

And in a tweet that has since been deleted, Sarsour expressed a desire to see Islam critics Brigitte Gabriel and Ayaan Hirsi Ali lose “their vaginas” for their opposition to sharia law.

Former President Barack Obama called Sarsour a “champion of change,” and Times listed her in its “100 most influential people.”

Twitter is forever: Women's March leader Linda Sarsour wants to grab Ayaan Hirsi Ali by the p*ssy. pic.twitter.com/XNZIwTwoE5 — SHIREEN QUDOSI (@ShireenQudosi) January 26, 2017

In conclusion, Klein wrote: “CUNY of all places should not be elevating and honoring Linda Sarsour, given the recent appalling revelations of anti-Semitism on several CUNY campuses… Instead, CUNY is showing breathtaking insensitivity by honoring and giving a prominent podium to a bigot, and someone who is using women’s issues to ostracize Jews and other Israel supporters from the fight for women’s rights and equality.

Please do all that you can to ensure that CUNY rescinds the speaking invitation to Linda Sarsour. There are many truly inspiring leaders worthy of the honor of speaking at a CUNY commencement. Linda Sarsour is not one of them.”

IT workers at the University of California intend to file a lawsuit challenging their dismissal after they were replaced by offshore workers, arguing that those sacked from the UC San Francisco campus were discriminated against based on age and national origin.

Around 80 people lost their positions in the department, including 50 full-time workers and 30 contractors, in a move that is unheard of in the public sector, where offsourcing is much less common than in the private sector. UCSF hired the India-based firm HCL to handle its services instead of the American workers.

Randall Strauss from Gwilliam Ivary Chiosso Cavalli & Brewer, the attorney representing the ex-employees, argued that “to take a workforce that is overwhelmingly over the age of 40 and replace them with folks who are mainly in their 20s – early 20s, in fact – we think is age discrimination.” The group also represents and “reflects the diversity of California” – to allow them to be “replaced with people who come from one particular part of the world” is discrimination based on their national origin, continued Strauss. The lawsuit will be filed in Alameda County Superior Court.

On Wednesday, details about UCSF’s financial situation emerged that may help the IT workers in their case. A report by a California state auditor found an undisclosed $175 million in funds in the university’s budget; the outsourcing would be estimated to save $10 million a year for the next 5 years.

The lead counsel on the case, J. Gary Gwilliam, released a statement on the subject of the university funding:

It is unbelievable to me that a public university would ship good American jobs overseas by telling the fired workers, the Regents, the Legislature and public of a crying need to save money, while at the same time maintaining a secret slush fund of $175 million dollars which would more than cover the cost of keeping all these jobs in California, leaving more than enough money leftover to cover the needs of the University and its students.

Similar lawsuits have been popping up around the country recently. In December, former IT workers at Disney filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming that American workers were being discriminated against in favor of hiring H-1B visa workers from overseas. Some staff members even alleged that they were forced to train their foreign replacements before being allowed to take their redundancy check.

Cliff Sims, special assistant to President Trump, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Thursday regarding several topics, including free speech on college campuses, the president’s tax plan, the Obamacare compromise bill, and the administration’s first 100 days.

Asked about recent events like the cancellation of Ann Coulter’s speech and the chilling impact on free speech of ongoing leftist protests at UC Berkeley and elsewhere, Sims said, “Free speech is the lynchpin of democracy here in the United States. As I watch personally what is going on out there, it is appalling.”

“It is a sad state of affairs to the legacy of … a campus that has been a beacon – considered itself a beacon of free speech throughout the years. And it is just disheartening to see that in the United States of America today that more and more free speech only applies to speech that you agree with.”

Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.
